# Notes on the Mode Splitting in Coupled Fibre-Loops
In the following, we will derive a first-order formula for the mode
splitting of two weakly coupled fiber loops, based on [Snyder's
work](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSA.62.001267). The usual performance
characteristic of a fiber coupler that is specified the manufacturer
is the power splitting. Herein, the mode splitting of two fibre loops
coupled with such a coupler will be expressed in terms of this
parameter.
