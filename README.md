# Notes on the Mode Splitting in Coupled Fibre-Loops
![Schematic of the fibre coupler that couples two fibers with mode
amplitudes $a$ and $b$ via an altered transversal refractive index
$ε^{*}$ that's only nonzero on a spatial region of length $Δz$. The $a$
mode is iluminated and couples into the $b$ mode. Here the case for
$n=0$ in [\[eq:16\]](#eq:16){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:16"} is
shown. The yellow line symbolizes the power of the electromagnetic
field. ](fibre_coupler){#fig:schem}

In the following, we will derive a first-order formula for the mode
splitting of two weakly coupled fiber loops, based on [Snyder's
work](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSA.62.001267). The usual performance
characteristic of a fiber coupler that is specified the manufacturer
is the power splitting. Herein, the mode splitting of two fibre loops
coupled with such a coupler will be expressed in terms of this
parameter.
