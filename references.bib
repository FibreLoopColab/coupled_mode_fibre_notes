  abstract = {Classical shadow tomography is a powerful randomized measurement protocol for predicting many properties of a quantum state with few measurements. Two classical shadow protocols have been extensively studied in the literature: the single-qubit (local) Pauli measurement, which is well suited for predicting local operators but inefficient for large operators; and the global Clifford measurement, which is efficient for low-rank operators but infeasible on near-term quantum devices due to the extensive gate overhead. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable classical shadow tomography approach for generic randomized measurements implemented with finite-depth local Clifford random unitary circuits, which interpolates between the limits of Pauli and Clifford measurements. The method combines the recently proposed locally-scrambled classical shadow tomography framework with tensor network techniques to achieve scalability for computing the classical shadow reconstruction map and evaluating various physical properties. The method enables classical shadow tomography to be performed on shallow quantum circuits with superior sample efficiency and minimal gate overhead and is friendly to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We show that the shallow-circuit measurement protocol provides immediate, exponential advantages over the Pauli measurement protocol for predicting quasi-local operators. It also enables a more efficient fidelity estimation compared to the Pauli measurement.},

  abstract = {Normal-conducting mesoscopic systems in contact with a superconductor are classified by the symmetry operations of time reversal and rotation of the electron's spin. Four symmetry classes are identified, which correspond to Cartan's symmetric spaces of type C, CI, D, and DIII. A detailed study is made of the systems where the phase shift due to Andreev reflection averages to zero along a typical semiclassical single-electron trajectory. Such systems are particularly interesting because they do not have a genuine excitation gap but support quasiparticle states close to the chemical potential. Disorder or dynamically generated chaos mixes the states and produces forms of universal level statistics different from Wigner-Dyson. For two of the four universality classes, the n-level correlation functions are calculated by the mapping on a free one-dimensional Fermi gas with a boundary. The remaining two classes are related to the Laguerre orthogonal and symplectic random-matrix ensembles. For a quantum dot with a normal-metal–superconducting geometry, the weak-localization correction to the conductance is calculated as a function of sticking probability and two perturbations breaking time-reversal symmetry and spin-rotation invariance. The universal conductance fluctuations are computed from a maximum-entropy S-matrix ensemble. They are larger by a factor of 2 than what is naively expected from the analogy with normal-conducting systems. This enhancement is explained by the doubling of the number of slow modes: owing to the coupling of particles and holes by the proximity to the superconductor, every cooperon and diffusion mode in the advanced-retarded channel entails a corresponding mode in the advanced-advanced (or retarded-retarded) channel. , This article appears in the following collection:},

  abstract = {We present a full symmetry classification of fermion matter in and out of thermal equilibrium. Our approach starts from first principles, the ten different classes of linear and antilinear state transformations in fermionic Fock spaces, and symmetries defined via invariance properties of the dynamical equation for the density matrix. The object of classification is then the generators of reversible dynamics, dissipation and fluctuations, featuring’ in the generally irreversible and interacting dynamical equations. A sharp distinction between the symmetries of equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium dynamics, respectively, arises from the different role played by “time” in these two cases: In unitary quantum mechanics as well as in “microreversible” thermal equilibrium, antilinear transformations combined with an inversion of time define time-reversal symmetry. However, out of equilibrium an inversion of time becomes meaningless, while antilinear transformations in Fock space remain physically significant, and hence must be considered in autonomy. The practical consequence of this dichotomy is a novel realization of antilinear symmetries (six out of the ten fundamental classes) in nonequilibrium quantum dynamics that is fundamentally different from the established rules of thermal equilibrium. At large times, the dynamical generators thus symmetry classified determine the steady-state nonequilibrium distributions for arbitrary interacting systems. To illustrate this principle, we consider the fixation of a symmetry protected topological phase in a system of interacting lattice fermions. More generally, we consider the practically important class of mean field interacting systems, represented by Gaussian states. This class is naturally described in the language of non-Hermitian matrices, which allows us to compare to previous classification schemes in the literature.},

This in particular implies that the class QMA is necessarily included by the class \$\{\{QIP\}\_1(2)\}\$ of problems having two-message quantum interactive proofs with perfect completeness, which gives the first nontrivial upper bound for QMA in terms of quantum interactive proofs. It is also proved that any problem having an m-message quantum interactive proof system necessarily has an (m+1)-message quantum interactive proof system with perfect completeness for every \$\{m \textbackslash geq 2\}\$. This improves the previous construction due to Kitaev and Watrous, which increases the number of messages by two to achieve perfect completeness, if not using the parallelization result.},

  abstract = {Quantum walks act in obviously different ways from their classical counterparts, but decoherence will lessen and close this gap between them. To understand this process, it is necessary to investigate the evolution of quantum walks under different decoherence situations. In this article, we study a non-Markovian decoherent quantum walk on a line. In a short time regime, the behavior of the walk deviates from both ideal quantum walks and classical random walks. The position variance as a measure of the quantum walk collapses and revives for a short time, and tends to have a linear relation with time. That is, the walker's behavior shows a diffusive spread over a long time limit, which is caused by non-Markovian dephasing affecting the quantum correlations between the quantum walker and his coin. We also study both quantum discord and measurement-induced disturbance as measures of the quantum correlations, and observe both collapse and revival in the short time regime, and the tendency to be zero in the long time limit. Therefore, quantum walks with non-Markovian decoherence tend to have diffusive spreading behavior over long time limits, while in the short time regime they oscillate between ballistic and diffusive spreading behavior, and the quantum correlation collapses and revives due to the memory effect.},

  abstract = {By utilizing the method of pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance, radio‐frequency energy in the form of pulses can be stored serially in a sample of nuclear spins and recalled at an arbitrary later time within the memory or relaxation time of the spin sample. Weak pulses of radio‐frequency energy condition the nuclear spins to start precessing in phase. After they become completely out of phase, a strong recollection pulse brings about a phase reversal of precession and produces a series of spin echoes in a sequence corresponding to direct or reverse order of input pulses. The echo amplitudes in such a series are given as a function of the number and strength of the input pulses and the conditions for maximum storage capacity in a spin ensemble are determined. The maximum specific storage capacity in liquids is expressed in terms of the thermal noise of the detecting apparatus, the effect of self‐diffusion of the molecules, and the relaxation times. The origin of undesired spin echoes arising from the interaction of input pulses is discussed, and means for eliminating these echoes by frequency and magnetic field modulation are discussed and applied. Extensive use is made of a magnetic field modulation technique to destroy undesired echoes, and to permit novel types of recall of serially stored groups of pulses. Whereas Fernbach and Proctor [J. Appl. Phys. 26, 170 (1955)] have demonstrated multiple pulse storage under conditions which reproduce the input pulse shape, the present investigation is concerned with the storage of a maximum number of pulses whose shape is ideally determined by the nuclear spin band width. In practice, the order of 1000 rf pulses can be stored and recalled by this method in a proton sample several cc in volume within a memory time of 10 to 50 milliseconds. Large specific storage capacities expected for existing long relaxation time liquids are not realized because of excessive self‐diffusion.},

The EFFH method is an approximate framework. Through a combination of the reaction-coordinate mapping, a polaron transformation and a controlled truncation, it imprints the system-bath coupling parameters into the system's Hamiltonian. First, we develop a \$\textbackslash textit\{variational\}\$ EFFH technique. In this method, system's parameters are renormalized by both the system-bath coupling parameters (as in the original EFFH approach) and the bath's temperature. Second, adopting the generalized spin-boson model, we benchmark the equilibrium state from the EFFH treatment against numerically-exact simulations and demonstrate a good agreement for both polarization and coherences using the Brownian spectral function. Third, we contrast the (normal and variational) EFFH approach with the familiar (normal and variational) polaron treatment. We show that the two methods predict a similar structure for the equilibrium state, albeit the EFFH approach offers the advantage of simpler calculations and closed-form analytical results. Altogether, we argue that for temperatures comparable to the system's frequencies, the EFFH methodology provides a good approximation for the mean-force Gibbs state in the full range of system-bath coupling, from ultraweak to ultrastrong.},

We show that the somewhat counterintuitive strategy of cutting links along a single line connecting A to B creates such a channel. The efficient transport along the cut is due to topologically protected chiral edge states, which exist even though the bulk Chern number in this system vanishes. We give a realization of the walk as a periodically driven lattice Hamiltonian and identify the bulk topological invariant responsible for the edge states as the quasienergy winding of this Hamiltonian.},

First, key theorems and central concepts in non-Hermitian linear algebra, including Jordan normal form, biorthogonality, exceptional points, pseudo-Hermiticity, and parity-time symmetry, are delineated in a pedagogical and mathematically coherent manner. Building on these, we provide an overview of how diverse classical systems, ranging from photonics, mechanics, electrical circuits, and acoustics to active matter, can be used to simulate non-Hermitian wave physics. In particular, we discuss rich and unique phenomena found therein, such as unidirectional invisibility, enhanced sensitivity, topological energy transfer, coherent perfect absorption, single-mode lasing, and robust biological transport. We then explain in detail how non-Hermitian operators emerge as an effective description of open quantum systems on the basis of the Feshbach projection approach and the quantum trajectory approach. We discuss their applications to physical systems relevant to a variety of fields, including atomic, molecular and optical physics, mesoscopic physics, and nuclear physics with emphasis on prominent phenomena and subjects in quantum regimes, such as quantum resonances, superradiance, the continuous quantum Zeno effect, quantum critical phenomena, Dirac spectra in quantum chromodynamics, and nonunitary conformal field theories. Finally, we introduce the notion of band topology in complex spectra of non-Hermitian systems and present their classifications by providing the proof, first given by this review in a complete manner, as well as a number of instructive examples. Other topics related to non-Hermitian physics, including nonreciprocal transport, speed limits, nonunitary quantum walk, are also reviewed.},

  abstract = {Classical electromagnetic fields and quantum mechanics obey the principle of superposition alike. This opens up many avenues for simulation of a large variety of phenomena and algorithms, which have hitherto been considered quantum mechanical. In this paper, we propose two such applications. In the first, we introduce a new, to the best of our knowledge, class of beams, called “equivalent optical beams,” in parallel with equivalent states introduced in [Phys. Rev. A89, 062110 (2014).PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.89.062110]. These beams have the same information content for all practical purposes. Employing them, we show how to transfer information from one degree of freedom of classical light to another, without need for classically entangled beams. Next, we show that quantum machine learning can be performed with OAM beams through the implementation of a quantum classifier circuit. We provide explicit protocols and explore the possibility of their experimental realization.},

Recent years have witnessed intense efforts toward exploiting these phenomena in photonics. Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic topological insulator laser system exhibiting topologically protected transport in the cavity. Its topological properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the topologically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active topological platforms by assembling the system from S-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields. This work paves the way toward active topological devices with exciting properties and functionalities.},

For example, exact quantization of the charge transported in a so-called Thouless adiabatic pump is lifted at any finite temperature in symmetry-protected topological insulators. Here, we show that certain directly observable many-body correlators preserve the integrity of topological invariants for mixed Gaussian quantum states in one dimension. Our approach relies on the expectation value of the many-body momentum-translation operator and leads to a physical observable—the “ensemble geometric phase” (EGP)—which represents a bona fide geometric phase for mixed quantum states, in the thermodynamic limit. In cyclic protocols, the EGP provides a topologically quantized observable that detects encircled spectral singularities (“purity-gap” closing points) of density matrices. While we identify the many-body nature of the EGP as a key ingredient, we propose a conceptually simple, interferometric setup to directly measure the latter in experiments with mesoscopic ensembles of ultracold atoms.},

Furthermore, they host topologically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to topological invariants that have been overlooked.

As a conceptually rich and immediately experimentally realizable example, we consider a three-dimensional topological insulator (TI) coupled to a ferromagnetic lead. Remarkably, the symmetry-protected TI is promoted in a dissipative fashion to a non-symmetry-protected NH Weyl phase with no direct Hermitian counterpart and which exhibits robustness against any perturbation. The transition between a gapped phase and the NH Weyl phase may be readily tuned experimentally with the magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic lead. Given the robustness of this exotic nodal phase, our general analysis also applies to, e.g., a two-dimensional electron gas close to criticality in proximity to a ferromagnetic lead. There, the predicted bulk Fermi arcs are directly amenable to surface spectroscopy methods such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.},

In particular, how the paramount and genuinely NH concept of exceptional degeneracies, at which both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, leads to phenomena drastically distinct from the familiar Hermitian realm is discussed. An immediate consequence is the ubiquitous occurrence of nodal NH topological phases with concomitant open Fermi-Seifert surfaces, where conventional band-touching points are replaced by the aforementioned exceptional degeneracies. Furthermore, new notions of gapped phases including topological phases in single-band systems are detailed, and the manner in which a given physical context may affect the symmetry-based topological classification is clarified. A unique property of NH systems with relevance beyond the field of topological phases consists of the anomalous relation between bulk and boundary physics, stemming from the striking sensitivity of NH matrices to boundary conditions. Unifying several complementary insights recently reported in this context, a picture of intriguing phenomena such as the NH bulk-boundary correspondence and the NH skin effect is put together. Finally, applications of NH topology in both classical systems including optical setups with gain and loss, electric circuits, and mechanical systems and genuine quantum systems such as electronic transport settings at material junctions and dissipative cold-atom setups are reviewed.},

Making use of Floquet theory, we focus on translationally invariant situations in which the single-particle dynamics can be described in terms of spatially extended Floquet-Bloch waves. We develop a general formalism for the scattering of these Floquet-Bloch waves. An important role is played by the conservation of Floquet quasienergy, which is defined only up to the addition of integer multiples of ℏω for a Hamiltonian with period T=2π/ω. We discuss the consequences of this for the interpretation of “elastic” and “inelastic” scattering in cases of physical interest. We illustrate our general results with applications to the scattering of a single particle in a Floquet-Bloch state from a static potential and the scattering of two bosonic particles in Floquet-Bloch states through their interparticle interaction. We analyze examples of these scattering processes that are closely related to the schemes used to generate artificial gauge fields in cold-atom experiments, through optical dressing of internal states, or through time-periodic modulations of tight-binding lattices. We show that the effects of scattering cannot, in general, be understood by an effective time-independent Hamiltonian, even in the limit ω→∞ of rapid modulation. We discuss the relative sizes of the elastic scattering (required to stabilize many-body phases) and of the inelastic scattering (leading to deleterious heating effects). In particular, we describe how inelastic processes that can cause significant heating in the current experimental setup can be switched off by additional confinement of transverse motion.},

While atomic cavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the latter has now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right. Circuit QED allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the quantum level in unprecedented detail. It also plays an essential role in all current approaches to gate-based digital quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. In addition, circuit QED provides a framework for the study of hybrid quantum systems, such as quantum dots, magnons, Rydberg atoms, surface acoustic waves, and mechanical systems interacting with microwave photons. Here the coherent coupling of superconducting qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators focusing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model, its dispersive limit, and the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system are reviewed. Also discussed is coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is necessary for coherent control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also invariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive qubit readout, a central ingredient in almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following an introduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit QED, important use cases of these ideas in quantum information processing and in quantum optics are discussed. Circuit QED realizes a broad set of concepts that open up new possibilities for the study of quantum physics at the macro scale with superconducting circuits and applications to quantum information science in the widest sense.},

Here we experimentally study topologically protected states in silicon at the interface between two dimer chains with different Zak phases. Furthermore, we propose and demonstrate that, in a system where topological and trivial defect modes coexist, we can probe them independently. Tuning the configuration of the interface, we observe the transition between a single topological defect and a compound trivial defect state. These results provide a new paradigm for topologically protected waveguiding in a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible platform and highlight the novel concept of isolating topological and trivial defect modes in the same system that can have important implications in topological physics.},

For the first time, we experimentally demonstrate photon echo operation at such a low signal intensity without any preparation step, which allows us to work with mere two-level atoms. This simplified approach relies on the so-coined ‘revival of silenced echo’ (ROSE) scheme. Low noise conditions are obtained by returning the atoms to the ground state before the echo emission. In the present paper we manage ROSE in photon counting conditions, showing that very strong control fields can be compatible with extremely weak signals, making ROSE consistent with quantum memory requirements.},

We detect the synthetic Hall effect through the predicted overlap oscillations at a quantized fundamental frequency proportional to the Chern number, which characterizes the topological phases of the system. We further observe half-quantization of the Chern number at the transition between the synthetic Hall regime and the trivial regime, and the associated concentration of local Berry curvature in synthetic phase space.

  abstract = {Braiding Majorana zero-modes around each other is a promising route toward topological quantum computing. Yet, two competing maxims emerge when implementing Majorana braiding in real systems: on the one hand, perfect braiding should be conducted adiabatically slowly to avoid non-topological errors. On the other hand, braiding must be conducted fast such that decoherence effects introduced by the environment are negligible, which are generally unavoidable in finite-size systems. This competition results in an intermediate time scale for Majorana braiding that is optimal, but generally not error-free. Here, we calculate this intermediate time scale for a T-junction of short one-dimensional topological superconductors coupled to a bosonic bath that generates fluctuations in the local electric potential, which stem from, e.g. environmental photons or phonons of the substrate. We thereby obtain boundaries for the speed of Majorana braiding with a predetermined gate fidelity. Our results emphasize the general susceptibility of Majorana-based information storage in finite-size systems and can serve as a guide for determining the optimal braiding times in future experiments.},

Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the Web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine — the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

As an exception, we present a quantum algorithm for graph isomorphism testing whose performance is optimal when operating in the partially coherent regime, as opposed to the extremes of fully coherent or classical regimes. The algorithm builds on continuous-time quantum stochastic walks (QSWs) on graphs and the algorithmic performance is quantified by the distinguishing power between nonisomorphic graphs. The QSW explores the entire graph and acquires information about the underlying structure, which is extracted by monitoring stochastic jumps across an auxiliary edge. The resulting counting statistics of stochastic jumps is used to identify the spectrum of the dynamical generator of the QSW, serving as a novel graph invariant, based on which nonisomorphic graphs are distinguished. We provide specific examples of nonisomorphic graphs that are only distinguishable by QSWs in the presence of decoherence.},

On the formal side, the book covers an introduction to second quantization, many-body Green's function, finite temperature Feynman diagrams and bosonization. The applications include traditional transport theory in bulk as well as mesoscopic systems, where both the Landau-Büttiker formalism and recent developments in correlated transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems and nano-structures are covered. Other topics include interacting electron gases, plasmons, electron-phonon interactions, superconductivity and a final chapter on one-dimensional systems where a detailed treatment of Luttinger liquid theory and bosonization techniques is given.

The notion of geometric phases has been extended from pure to mixed states by Uhlmann [Rep. Math. Phys. 24, 229 (1986)], who discovered an emergent gauge theory over the density matrices based on their pure state representation in a larger Hilbert space. However, since the uniquely defined square root √ρ of a density matrix ρ provides a global gauge, this construction is always topologically trivial. Here, we study a more restrictive gauge structure which can be topologically nontrivial and is capable of resolving homotopically distinct mappings of density matrices subject to various spectral constraints. Remarkably, in this framework, topological invariants can be directly defined and calculated for mixed states. In the limit of pure states, the well-known system of topological invariants for gapped band structures at zero temperature is reproduced. We compare our construction with recent approaches to Chern insulators at finite temperature.},

In particular, we show that the DTOP can change its integer value at discrete times where so called dynamical quantum phase transitions occur, thus serving as a dynamical analog of an order parameter. Interestingly, studying quantum quenches in one-dimensional two-banded Bogoliubov–de Gennes models, we find that the DTOP is capable of resolving if the topology of the system Hamiltonian has changed over the quench. Furthermore, we investigate the relation of the DTOP to the dynamics of the string order parameter that characterizes the topology of such systems in thermal equilibrium.},

In equilibrium, we show that the topological marker can be used to extract the critical behaviour of topological phase transitions. Out of equilibrium, we show that the topological marker spreads via a flow of currents emanating from the sample boundaries, and with a bounded maximum propagation speed. We discuss the possibilities for measuring the topological marker and its flow in experiment.},

  abstract = {We present a new quantum heuristic algorithm aimed at finding satisfying assignments for hard K-SAT instances using a continuous time quantum walk that explicitly exploits the properties of quantum tunneling. Our algorithm uses a Hamiltonian \$\$H\_A(F)\$\$which is specifically constructed to solve a K-SAT instance F. The heuristic algorithm aims at iteratively reducing the Hamming distance between an evolving state \$\$\{|\{\textbackslash psi \_j\}\textbackslash rangle \}\$\$and a state that represents a satisfying assignment for F. Each iteration consists on the evolution of \$\$\{|\{\textbackslash psi \_j\}\textbackslash rangle \}\$\$(where j is the iteration number) under \$\$e\textasciicircum\{-iH\_At\}\$\$, a measurement that collapses the superposition, a check to see if the post-measurement state satisfies F and in the case it does not, an update to \$\$H\_A\$\$for the next iteration. Operator \$\$H\_A\$\$describes a continuous time quantum walk over a hypercube graph with potential barriers that makes an evolving state to scatter and mostly follow the shortest tunneling paths with the smaller potentials that lead to a state \$\$\{|\{s\}\textbackslash rangle \}\$\$that represents a satisfying assignment for F. The potential barriers in the Hamiltonian \$\$H\_A\$\$are constructed through a process that does not require any previous knowledge on the satisfying assignments for the instance F. Due to the topology of \$\$H\_A\$\$each iteration is expected to reduce the Hamming distance between each post measurement state and a state \$\$\{|\{s\}\textbackslash rangle \}\$\$. If the state \$\$\{|\{s\}\textbackslash rangle \}\$\$is not measured after n iterations (the number n of logical variables in the instance F being solved), the algorithm is restarted. Periodic measurements and quantum tunneling also give the possibility of getting out of local minima. Our numerical simulations show a success rate of 0.66 on measuring \$\$\{|\{s\}\textbackslash rangle \}\$\$on the first run of the algorithm (i.e., without restarting after n iterations) on thousands of 3-SAT instances of 4, 6, and 10 variables with unique satisfying assignments.},

Recently, controlled protocols of quantum walk (QW) are proving to be effective simulators of such phenomena. Here we report the realization of a photonic QW showing both the trivial and the non-trivial topologies associated with chiral symmetry in one-dimensional (1D) periodic systems. We find that the probability distribution moments of the walker position after many steps can be used as direct indicators of the topological quantum transition: while varying a control parameter that defines the system phase, these moments exhibit a slope discontinuity at the transition point. Numerical simulations strongly support the conjecture that these features are general of 1D topological systems. Extending this approach to higher dimensions, different topological classes, and other typologies of quantum phases may offer general instruments for investigating and experimentally detecting quantum transitions in such complex systems.},

We express the photon-number moments of a Gaussian state in terms of the loop Hafnian, a function that when applied to \$(0,1)\$-matrices representing the adjacency of a graph, counts the number of its perfect matchings. We then use these expressions to calculate genuine photon-number correlations between modes in terms of cumulants. We show that when a uniformly lossy interferometer is fed in every input with identical single-mode Gaussian states with zero displacement, all the odd-order cumulants but the first one are zero. Finally, we employ the expressions we derive to study the distribution of cumulants up to the fourth order for different input states in a Gaussian boson sampling setup where \$K\$ identical states are fed into an \$\textbackslash ell\$-mode interferometer. We analyze the dependence of the cumulants as a function of the type of state, squeezed, lossy squeezed, squashed, or thermal, and as a function of the number of non-vacuum inputs. We find that thermal states perform much worse than other classical states, such as squashed states, at mimicking the photon-number cumulants of lossy or lossless squeezed states.},

  abstract = {We give a topological classification of quantum walks on an infinite 1D lattice, which obey one of the discrete symmetry groups of the tenfold way, have a gap around some eigenvalues at symmetry protected points, and satisfy a mild locality condition. No translation invariance is assumed. The classification is parameterized by three indices, taking values in a group, which is either trivial, the group of integers, or the group of integers modulo 2, depending on the type of symmetry. The classification is complete in the sense that two walks have the same indices if and only if they can be connected by a norm-continuous path along which all the mentioned properties remain valid. Of the three indices, two are related to the asymptotic behavior far to the right and far to the left, respectively. These are also stable under compact perturbations. The third index is sensitive to those compact perturbations which cannot be contracted to a trivial one. The results apply to the Hamiltonian case as well. In this case, all compact perturbations can be contracted, so the third index is not defined. Our classification extends the one known in the translation- invariant case, where the asymptotic right and left indices add up to zero, and the third one vanishes, leaving effectively only one independent index. When two translation-invariant bulks with distinct indices are joined, the left and right asymptotic indices of the joined walk are thereby fixed, and there must be eigenvalues at 1 or \$\$-\textbackslash,1\$\$(bulk-boundary correspondence). Their location is governed by the third index. We also discuss how the theory applies to finite lattices, with suitable homogeneity assumptions.},

We prove that topological indices classifying symmetry protected topological phases of quantum walks are encoded by matrix Schur functions built out of the walk. This main result of the paper reduces the calculation of these topological indices to a linear algebra problem: calculating symmetry indices of finite-dimensional unitaries obtained by evaluating such matrix Schur functions at the symmetry protected points \$\$\textbackslash pm 1\$\$. The Schur representation fully covers the complete set of symmetry indices for 1D quantum walks with a group of symmetries realizing any of the symmetry types of the tenfold way. The main advantage of the Schur approach is its validity in the absence of translation invariance, which allows us to go beyond standard Fourier methods, leading to the complete classification of non-translation invariant phases for typical examples.},

  abstract = {The introduction of non-Hermiticity to topological systems profoundly modifies their topological properties, leading to unprecedented phenomena beyond the descriptions of Bloch band theory, e.g., the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. However, the comprehensive interplay between band topology and non-Hermiticity remains elusive. Here, based on a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate that in the non-Hermitian topological systems, band topology and non-Hermiticity interplay by competing with each other, exhibiting a transition from symmetry dominance to non-Hermitian dominance. The former is featured with two edge states separately distributed at the two ends of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, similar to their Hermitian counterparts. In the latter, however, driven by non-Hermiticity, the two edge states become localized toward the same chain end, exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect. We find that such a transition is a universal behavior in the non-Hermitian systems, which is responsible for the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence and is the key factor to understanding the non-Hermitian topological properties. Furthermore, it is shown that this transition can be modified by the mode coupling between the edge states. As a comparison, we propose a non-Hermitian square-root Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, where the edge states do not couple with each other and the mode coupling effect can be deactivated. Our work explicitly reveals the interplay between band topology and non-Hermiticity, which lays the foundation for the studies of non-Hermitian topological physics.},

  abstract = {Non-Abelian gauge fields give rise to nontrivial topological physics. Here we develop a scheme to create an arbitrary SU(2) lattice gauge field for photons in the synthetic frequency dimension using an array of dynamically modulated ring resonators. The photon polarization is taken as the spin basis to implement the matrix-valued gauge fields. Using a non-Abelian generalization of the Harper-Hofstadter Hamiltonian as a specific example, we show that the measurement of the steady-state photon amplitudes inside the resonators can reveal the band structures of the Hamiltonian, which show signatures of the underlying non-Abelian gauge field. These results provide opportunities to explore novel topological phenomena associated with non-Abelian lattice gauge fields in photonic systems.},

One of the hallmarks of topological materials is the existence of protected gapless surface states, which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bulk wave functions. This review provides a pedagogical introduction into the field of topological quantum matter with an emphasis on classification schemes. Both fully gapped and gapless topological materials and their classification in terms of nonspatial symmetries, such as time reversal, as well as spatial symmetries, such as reflection, are considered. Furthermore, the classification of gapless modes localized on topological defects is surveyed. The classification of these systems is discussed by use of homotopy groups, Clifford algebras, K theory, and nonlinear sigma models describing the Anderson (de)localization at the surface or inside a defect of the material. Theoretical model systems and their topological invariants are reviewed together with recent experimental results in order to provide a unified and comprehensive perspective of the field. While the bulk of this article is concerned with the topological properties of noninteracting or mean-field Hamiltonians, a brief overview of recent results and open questions concerning the topological classifications of interacting systems is also provided.},

We find that such transitions arise due to enforced exceptional points which can be predicted directly from the bulk Bloch wave functions. This allows us to establish a new type of bulk-boundary correspondence for non-Hermitian systems and to compute the phase diagram of an open chain analytically. Finally, we demonstrate topological lasing of a single end mode in a realistic model of a microcavity lattice.},

We consider a generalization of the discrete-time coined quantum walk model that accounts for the interaction between quantum walks in the network graph with quantum registers inside the network nodes. QWCP allows for the implementation of networked quantum services, such as distributed quantum computing and entanglement distribution, abstracting hardware implementation and the transmission of quantum information through channels. Multiple interacting quantum walks can be used to propagate entangled control signals across the network in parallel. We demonstrate how to use QWCP to perform distributed multi-qubit controlled gates, which shows the universality of the protocol for distributed quantum computing.

  abstract = {The quantum mixing time is a critical factor affecting the efficiency of quantum sampling and algorithm performance. It refers to the minimum time required for a quantum walk to approach its limiting distribution closely and has implications across the areas of quantum computation. This work focuses on the continuous time quantum walk mixing on a regular graph, evolving according to the unitary map \$U = e\textasciicircum\{i \textbackslash Bar\{A\}t\}\$, where the Hamiltonian \$\textbackslash Bar\{A\}\$ is the normalized adjacency matrix of the graph. In\textasciitilde [Physical Review A 76, 042306 (2007).], Richter previously showed that this walk mixes in time \$O(n d\textbackslash log\{(d)\textbackslash log\{(1/\textbackslash epsilon)\}\})\$ with \$O( \textbackslash log\{(d)\textbackslash log\{(1/\textbackslash epsilon)\}\})\$ intermediate measurements when the graph is the \$d-\$dimensional periodic lattice \$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_\{n\}\textbackslash times \textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_\{n\}\textbackslash times \textbackslash dots \textbackslash times \textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_\{n\}\$. We extend this analysis to the periodic lattice \$\textbackslash mathcal\{L\} = \textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_\{n\_1\}\textbackslash times \textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_\{n\_2\}\textbackslash times \textbackslash dots \textbackslash times \textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_\{n\_d\}\$, relaxing the assumption that \$n\_i\$ are identical.We provide two quantum walks on periodic lattices that achieve faster mixing compared to classical random walks: 1. A coordinate-wise quantum walk that mixes in \$O\textbackslash Big(\textbackslash Big(\textbackslash sum\_\{i=1\}\textasciicircum\{d\} n\_i \textbackslash Big) \textbackslash log\{(d/\textbackslash epsilon)\}\textbackslash Big)\$ time with \$O(d \textbackslash log(d/\textbackslash epsilon))\$ measurements. 2. A continuous-time quantum walk with \$O(\textbackslash log(1/\textbackslash epsilon))\$ measurements that conjecturally mixes in \$O(\textbackslash sum\_\{i=1\}\textasciicircum d n\_i(\textbackslash log(n\_1))\textasciicircum 2 \textbackslash log(1/\textbackslash epsilon))\$ time. Our results demonstrate a quadratic speedup over the classical~ mixing time \$O(dn\_1\textasciicircum 2 \textbackslash log(d/\textbackslash epsilon))\$ on the generalized periodic lattice \$\textbackslash mathcal\{L\}\$. We have provided analytical evidence and numerical simulations to support the conjectured faster mixing time of the continuous-time quantum walk algorithm.Making progress towards proving the general conjecture that quantum walks on regular graphs mix in \$O(\textbackslash delta\textasciicircum\{-1/2\} \textbackslash log(N) \textbackslash log(1/\textbackslash epsilon))\$ time, where \$\textbackslash delta\$ is the spectral gap and \$N\$ is the number of vertices.},

It contains four phases with the long-range order of different types and a disordered phase. These phases are separated by critical lines, where the gap and the long-range order vanish. Using scaling estimates, the mean-field approach, and numerical calculations in the vicinity of all critical lines, we find the critical exponents of the gap and the long-range order.

Recently, work has been done to propose several local analogs of the Chern number, called local markers, that can be used to characterize disordered systems. However, it was unclear whether the proposed markers represented a physically measurable property of the system. Here we propose a local marker starting from a physical argument, as a local cross conductivity measured in the bulk of the system. We find the explicit form of the marker for a noninteracting system of electrons on the lattice and show that it corresponds to existing expressions for the Chern number. Examples are calculated for a variety of disordered and amorphous systems, showing that it is precisely quantized to the Chern number and robust against disorder.},

  abstract = {Quantum information technologies, on the one hand, and intelligent learning systems, on the other, are both emergent technologies that are likely to have a transformative impact on our society in the future. The respective underlying fields of basic research—quantum information versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)—have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question of the extent to which these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. Quantum ML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for ML problems, critical in our ‘big data’ world. Conversely, ML already permeates many cutting-edge technologies and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement—exploring what ML/AI can do for quantum physics and vice versa—researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating ML and AI in the quantum domain.},

For these systems, the concept of band structure along the synthetic dimension plays a central role in their theoretical description. Here we provide a direct experimental measurement of the band structure along the synthetic dimension. By dynamically modulating a resonator at frequencies commensurate with its mode spacing, we create a periodically driven lattice of coupled modes in the frequency dimension. The strength and range of couplings can be dynamically reconfigured by changing the modulation amplitude and frequency. We show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that time-resolved transmission measurements of this system provide a direct readout of its band structure. We also realize long-range coupling, gauge potentials and nonreciprocal bands by simply incorporating additional frequency drives, enabling great flexibility in band structure engineering.},

  abstract = {Conventional topological insulators support boundary states with dimension one lower than that of the bulk system that hosts them, and these states are topologically protected due to quantized bulk dipole moments. Recently, higherorder topological insulators have been proposed as a way of realizing topological states with dimensions two or more lower than that of the bulk due to the quantization of bulk quadrupole or octupole moments. However, all these proposals as well as experimental realizations have been restricted to real-space dimensions. Here, we construct photonic higher-order topological insulators (PHOTIs) in synthetic dimensions. We show the emergence of a quadrupole PHOTI supporting topologically protected corner modes in an array of modulated photonic molecules with a synthetic frequency dimension, where each photonic molecule comprises two coupled rings. By changing the phase difference of the modulation between adjacent coupled photonic molecules, we predict a dynamical topological phase transition in the PHOTI. Furthermore, we show that the concept of synthetic dimensions can be exploited to realize even higher-order multipole moments such as a fourth-order hexadecapole (16-pole) insulator supporting 0D corner modes in a 4D hypercubic synthetic lattice that cannot be realized in real-space lattices.},

The study reveals electronic quantum beats characteristic of wavelike energy motion within the bacteriochlorophyll complex from the green sulphur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum. This wavelike characteristic of the energy transfer process can explain the extreme efficiency of photosynthesis, in that vast areas of phase space can be sampled effectively to find the most efficient path for energy transfer.},

We examine two classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians supporting real bulk eigenenergies in weak non-Hermiticity: SU(1,1) and SO(3,2) Hamiltonians. As an SU(1,1) Hamiltonian, the tight-binding model on the honeycomb lattice with imaginary onsite potentials is examined. Edge states with ReE=0 and their topological stability are discussed by the winding number and the index theorem based on the pseudo-anti-Hermiticity of the system. As a higher-symmetric generalization of SU(1,1) Hamiltonians, we also consider SO(3,2) models. We investigate non-Hermitian generalization of the Luttinger Hamiltonian on the square lattice and that of the Kane-Mele model on the honeycomb lattice, respectively. Using the generalized Kramers theorem for the time-reversal operator Θ with Θ2=+1 [M. Sato et al., e-print arXiv:1106.1806], we introduce a time-reversal-invariant Chern number from which topological stability of gapless edge modes is argued.},

We also investigate how quantum walks are different in topological and trivial phases by simulating the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in electric circuits. We then generalize them to include dissipation and nonreciprocity by introducing resistors, which produce non-Hermitian effects. We point out that the time evolution of one-dimensional quantum walks is exactly solvable with the use of the generating function made of the Bessel functions.},

We prove that if the classical strategy succeeds in reaching level n in time polynomial in n, then so does the quantum algorithm. Moreover, we find examples of trees for which the classical algorithm requires time exponential in n, but for which the quantum algorithm succeeds in polynomial time.

In recent years, the growing interest in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers has lead to intense efforts being directed at understanding the computational advantages of open quantum systems. In this work, we extend the quantum walk model to open noisy systems in order to provide such a tool for the study of NISQ computers. Our method does not use explicit purification, and allows to ignore the environment degrees of freedom and obtain a much more efficient implementation (linear rather than exponential in the runtime), which employs no ancillas, hence provides direct access to the entanglement properties of the system. In our scheme, the quantum walk amplitudes represent elements of the density matrix rather than the wavefunction of a pure state. Despite the non-trivial manifestation of the normalization requirement in this setting, we model the application of general unitary gates and nonunitary channels, with an explicit implementation protocol for channels that are commonly used in noise models.},

The study is based on the equation of motion of a minimum set of operators, which is then used to define the state of the system. The relation between the quantum framework and the thermodynamical observables is examined. A four-stroke heat engine model with a coupled two-level system as a working fluid is used to explore the fundamental relations. In the model used, the internal Hamiltonian does not commute with the external control field, which defines the two adiabatic branches. Heat is transferred to the working fluid by coupling to hot and cold reservoirs under constant field values. Explicit quantum equations of motion for the relevant observables are derived on all branches. The dynamics on the heat transfer constant field branches is solved in closed form. On the adiabats, a general numerical solution is used and compared with a particular analytic solution. These solutions are combined to construct the cycle of operation. The engine is then analyzed in terms of the frequency-entropy and entropy-temperature graphs. The irreversible nature of the engine is the result of finite heat transfer rates and frictionlike behavior due to noncommutability of the internal and external Hamiltonians.},

Using a continuous-time Monte Carlo method, we explicitly compute the low-temperature nonequilibrium dynamics of the toric code on finite lattices. In contrast to the size-independent bound predicted for the toric code in the thermodynamic limit, we identify a low-temperature regime on finite lattices below a size-dependent crossover temperature with nontrivial finite-size and temperature scaling of the relaxation time. We demonstrate how this nontrivial finite-size scaling is governed by the scaling of topologically nontrivial two-dimensional classical random walks. The transition out of this low-temperature regime defines a dynamical finite-size crossover temperature that scales inversely with the log of the system size, in agreement with a crossover temperature defined from equilibrium properties. We find that both the finite-size and finite-temperature scaling are stronger in the low-temperature regime than above the crossover temperature. Since this finite-temperature scaling competes with the scaling of the robustness to unitary perturbations, this analysis may elucidate the scaling of memory lifetimes of possible physical realizations of topological qubits.},

In particular, we have witnessed rapid progress in the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) technology, which has emerged as one of the most promising physical systems that is capable of addressing the key challenges in realizing full-stack quantum computing on a large scale. In this Tutorial, we present some of the most crucial building blocks developed by the cQED community in recent years and a précis of the latest achievements towards robust universal quantum computation. More importantly, we aim to provide a synoptic outline of the core techniques that underlie most cQED experiments and offer a practical guide for a novice experimentalist to design, construct, and characterize their first quantum device.},

Quantum Langevin equations are developed, in which the Langevin forces are the field operators corresponding to the input modes. Time-reversed equations exist in which the Langevin forces are the output modes, and the sign of damping is reversed. Causality and boundary conditions relating inputs to system variables are developed. The concept of ‘‘quantum white noise’’ is formulated, and the formal relationship between quantum Langevin equations and quantum stochastic differential equations (SDE’s) is established. In analogy to the classical formulation, there are two kinds of SDE’s: the Ito and the Stratonovich forms. Rules are developed for converting from one to the other. These rules depend on the nature of the quantum white noise, which may be squeezed. The SDE’s developed are shown to be exactly equivalent to quantum master equations, and rules are developed for computing multitime-ordered correlation functions with use of the appropriate master equation. With use of the causality and boundary conditions, the relationship between correlation functions of the output and those of the system and the input is developed. It is possible to calculate what kind of output statistics result, provided that one knows the input statistics and provided that one can compute the system correlation functions.},

Our results concentrate around the comparison of the two architectures in terms of structure, benefits, and detriments, as well as the computational resources needed for each approach. We show that the inverter approach requires exponentially fewer gates than the rotations but almost half the number of qubits in the system. Finally, we execute a number of experiments using an IBM quantum computer. The experiments show the effects of noise in our circuits. Small two-qubit quantum walks evolve closer to our expectations, whereas for a larger number of steps or state space the evolution is severely affected by noise.},

Such bulk–edge correspondence has enabled the creation of robust electronic, electromagnetic, and mechanical transport properties across a wide range of systems, from cold atoms to metamaterials, active matter, and geophysical flows. Recently, the advent of non-Hermitian topological systems—wherein energy is not conserved—has sparked considerable theoretical advances. In particular, novel topological phases that can only exist in non-Hermitian systems have been introduced. However, whether such phases can be experimentally observed, and what their properties are, have remained open questions. Here, we identify and observe a form of bulk–edge correspondence for a particular non-Hermitian topological phase. We find that a change in the bulk non-Hermitian topological invariant leads to a change of topological edge-mode localization together with peculiar purely non-Hermitian properties. Using a quantum-to-classical analogy, we create a mechanical metamaterial with nonreciprocal interactions, in which we observe experimentally the predicted bulk–edge correspondence, demonstrating its robustness. Our results open avenues for the field of non-Hermitian topology and for manipulating waves in unprecedented fashions.},

  abstract = {Within the broad and deep field of topological materials, there are an ever-increasing number of materials that harbor topological phases. While condensed matter physics continues to probe the exotic physical properties resulting from the existence of topological phases in new materials, there exists a suite of “well-known” topological materials in which the physical properties are well-characterized, such as Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3. In this context, it is then appropriate to ask if the unique properties of well-explored topological materials may have a role to play in applications that form the basis of a new paradigm in information processing devices and architectures. To accomplish such a transition from physical novelty to application based material, the potential of topological materials must be disseminated beyond the reach of condensed matter to engender interest in diverse areas such as: electrical engineering, materials science, and applied physics. Accordingly, in this review, we assess the state of current electronic device applications and contemplate the future prospects of topological materials from an applied perspective. More specifically, we will review the application of topological materials to the general areas of electronic and magnetic device technologies with the goal of elucidating the potential utility of well-characterized topological materials in future information processing applications.},

  abstract = {Under the Born–Markov approximation, a qubit system, such as a two-level atom, is known to undergo a memoryless decay of quantum coherence or excitation when weakly coupled to a featureless environment. Recently, it has been shown that unavoidable disorder in the environment is responsible for non-Markovian effects and information backflow from the environment into the system owing to Anderson localization. This turns disorder into a resource for enhancing non-Markovianity in the system–environment dynamics, which could be of relevance in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here we consider the decoherence dynamics of a qubit weakly coupled to a two-dimensional bath with a nontrivial topological phase, such as a two-level atom embedded in a two-dimensional coupled-cavity array with a synthetic gauge field realizing a quantum-Hall bath, and show that Markovianity is protected against moderate disorder owing to the robustness of chiral edge modes in the quantum-Hall bath. Interestingly, switching off the gauge field, i.e., flipping the bath into a topological trivial phase, allows one to re-introduce non-Markovian effects. Such a result indicates that changing the topological phase of a bath by a tunable synthetic gauge field can be harnessed to control non-Markovian effects and quantum information backflow in a qubit-environment system.},

  abstract = {We investigate the validity of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach in describing quantum transport in disordered tight-binding networks connected to external environments, acting as sinks. Usually, non-Hermitian terms are added, on a phenomenological basis, to such networks to summarize the effects of the coupling to the sinks. Here, we consider a paradigmatic model of open quantum network for which we derive a non-Hermitian effective model, discussing its limit of validity by a comparison with the analysis of the full Hermitian model. Specifically, we consider a ring of sites connected to a central one-dimensional lead. The lead acts as a sink that absorbs the excitation initially present in the ring. The coupling strength to the lead controls the opening of the ring system. This model has been widely discussed in literature in the context of light-harvesting systems. We analyze the effectiveness of the non-Hermitian description both in absence and in presence of static disorder on the ring. In both cases, the non-Hermitian model is valid when the energy range determined by the eigenvalues of the ring Hamiltonian is smaller than the energy band in the lead. Under such condition, we show that results about the interplay of opening and disorder, previously obtained within the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach, remain valid when the full Hermitian model in presence of disorder is considered. The results of our analysis can be extended to generic networks with sinks, leading to the conclusion that the non-Hermitian approach is valid when the energy dependence of the coupling to the external environments is sufficiently smooth in the energy range spanned by the eigenstates of the network.},

This is rather surprising, because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point.},

  abstract = {While Hermiticity lies at the heart of quantum mechanics, recent experimental advances in controlling dissipation have brought about unprecedented flexibility in engineering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in open classical and quantum systems. Examples include parity-time-symmetric optical systems with gain and loss, dissipative Bose-Einstein condensates, exciton-polariton systems, and biological networks. A particular interest centers on the topological properties of non-Hermitian systems, which exhibit unique phases with no Hermitian counterparts. However, no systematic understanding in analogy with the periodic table of topological insulators and superconductors has been achieved. In this paper, we develop a coherent framework of topological phases of non-Hermitian systems. After elucidating the physical meaning and the mathematical definition of non-Hermitian topological phases, we start with one-dimensional lattices, which exhibit topological phases with no Hermitian counterparts and are found to be characterized by an integer topological winding number even with no symmetry constraint, reminiscent of the quantum-Hall insulator in Hermitian systems. A system with a nonzero winding number, which is experimentally measurable from the wave-packet dynamics, is shown to be robust against disorder, a phenomenon observed in the Hatano-Nelson model with asymmetric hopping amplitudes. We also unveil a novel bulk-edge correspondence that features an infinite number of (quasi)edge modes. We then apply the K theory to systematically classify all the non-Hermitian topological phases in the Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) classes in all dimensions. The obtained periodic table unifies time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries, leading to highly nontrivial predictions such as the absence of non-Hermitian topological phases in two dimensions. We provide concrete examples for all the nontrivial non-Hermitian AZ classes in zero and one dimensions. In particular, we identify a Z2 topological index for arbitrary quantum channels (completely positive trace-preserving maps). Our work lays the cornerstone for a unified understanding of the role of topology in non-Hermitian systems.},

Electronic and nuclear spins are natural candidates for the storage medium as their coherence time can be well above 1 s. Benefiting from these long coherence times requires one to apply the refocusing techniques used in magnetic resonance, a major challenge in the context of hybrid quantum circuits. Here, we report the first implementation of such a scheme, using ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond coupled to a superconducting resonator, in a setup compatible with superconducting qubit technology. We implement the active reset of the nitrogen-vacancy spins into their ground state by optical pumping and their refocusing by Hahn-echo sequences. This enables the storage of multiple microwave pulses at the picowatt level and their retrieval after up to 35 μs, a 3 orders of magnitude improvement compared to previous experiments.},

At intermediate times, DQC(t) does depend on the graph topology through its algebraic connectivity. Our results show that the difference in the dynamical behavior of classical and quantum walks is entirely due to the emergence of quantum features at short times. In the long-time limit, quantumness and the different nature of the generators of the dynamics, e.g., the open-system nature of classical walks and the unitary nature of quantum walks, are instead contributing equally.},

In particular, we show that the longest relaxation time τ that is maximized over initial states and local observables is given by τ∼Δ−1(1+L/ξ) with L being the system size. This implies that the longest relaxation time can diverge for L→∞ without gap closing.},

Based on its uncertainty and measurement collapse principle, this study proposes an image encryption system based on two-dimensional quantum walks and quantum coding. First, a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) based on quantum entanglement and coherence principles is designed to generate a secret code stream inconsistent with the original image. Second, using the new enhanced quantum representation (NEQR) model, a quantum right cyclic shift operator and a quantum XOR operator are designed to obtain the final encrypted image. Experimental results and analysis show that the image encryption scheme has high security performance.},

For the spin-boson model with sub-Ohmic spectral density considered here, a discretization of the spectral density based on an exponential distribution, used previously, turns out to be most favorable.},

  abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe∕CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1−xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

This is not always a valid approximation, however, as the inclusion of features such as gain and loss, or periodic driving, qualitatively amends these laws. A contemporary frontier of metamaterial research is the challenge open systems pose to the characterization of topological matter1,2. Here, one of the most relied upon principles is the bulk–boundary correspondence (BBC), which intimately relates the surface states to the topological classification of the bulk3,4. The presence of gain and loss, in combination with the violation of reciprocity, has been predicted to affect this principle dramatically5,6. Here, we report the experimental observation of BBC violation in a non-reciprocal topolectric circuit7, which is also referred to as the non-Hermitian skin effect. The circuit admittance spectrum exhibits an unprecedented sensitivity to the presence of a boundary, displaying an extensive admittance mode localization despite a translationally invariant bulk. Intriguingly, we measure a non-local voltage response due to broken BBC. Depending on the a.c. current feed frequency, the voltage signal accumulates at the left or right boundary, and increases as a function of nodal distance to the current feed.},

Numerical algorithms approximate intractable quantities from computable ones. They estimate integrals from evaluations of the integrand, or the path of a dynamical system described by differential equations from evaluations of the vector field. In other words, they infer a latent quantity from data. This book shows that it is thus formally possible to think of computational routines as learning machines, and to use the notion of Bayesian inference to build more flexible, efficient, or customised algorithms for computation. The text caters for Masters' and PhD students, as well as postgraduate researchers in artificial intelligence, computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics. Extensive background material is provided along with a wealth of figures, worked examples, and exercises (with solutions) to develop intuition.},

Provided that the insulator supports an anomalous topological phase, non-Hermiticity allows us to modify the boundary states independently of the bulk, without sacrificing their topological nature. We explore the ensuing possibilities for a Floquet topological insulator with non-Hermitian time-reversal symmetry, where the helical transport via counterpropagating boundary states can be tailored in ways that overcome the constraints imposed by Hermiticity. Non-Hermitian boundary state engineering specifically enables the enhancement of boundary transport relative to bulk motion, helical transport with a preferred direction, and chiral transport in the same direction on opposite boundaries. We explain the experimental relevance of our findings for the example of photonic waveguide lattices.},

  abstract = {Classical shadows are a powerful method for learning many properties of quantum states in a sample-efficient manner, by making use of randomized measurements. Here we study the sample complexity of learning the expectation value of Pauli operators via ``shallow shadows'', a recently-proposed version of classical shadows in which the randomization step is effected by a local unitary circuit of variable depth \$t\$. We show that the shadow norm (the quantity controlling the sample complexity) is expressed in terms of properties of the Heisenberg time evolution of operators under the randomizing (``twirling'') circuit -- namely the evolution of the weight distribution characterizing the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially. For spatially-contiguous Pauli operators of weight \$k\$, this entails a competition between two processes: operator spreading (whereby the support of an operator grows over time, increasing its weight) and operator relaxation (whereby the bulk of the operator develops an equilibrium density of identity operators, decreasing its weight). From this simple picture we derive (i) an upper bound on the shadow norm which, for depth \$t\textbackslash sim \textbackslash log(k)\$, guarantees an exponential gain in sample complexity over the \$t=0\$ protocol in any spatial dimension, and (ii) quantitative results in one dimension within a mean-field approximation, including a universal subleading correction to the optimal depth, found to be in excellent agreement with infinite matrix product state numerical simulations. Our work connects fundamental ideas in quantum many-body dynamics to applications in quantum information science, and paves the way to highly-optimized protocols for learning different properties of quantum states.},

  abstract = {We investigate the static and the dynamical behavior of localizable entanglement and its lower bounds on nontrivial loops of topological quantum codes with parallel magnetic field. Exploiting the connection between the stabilizer states and graph states in the absence of the parallel field and external noise, we identify a specific measurement basis, referred to as the canonical measurement basis, that optimizes localizable entanglement when measurement is restricted to single-qubit Pauli measurements only, thereby providing a lower bound. In situations where computing even the lower bound is difficult, we propose an approximation of the lower bound that can be computed for larger systems according to the computational resource in hand. Additionally, we compute a lower bound of the localizable entanglement that can be computed by determining the expectation value of an appropriately designed witness operator. We investigate the behavior of these lower bounds in the vicinity of the topological to nontopological quantum phase transition of the system, and perform a finite-size scaling analysis. We also investigate the dynamical features of these lower bounds when the system is subjected to Markovian or non-Markovian single-qubit dephasing noise. We find that in the case of the non-Markovian dephasing noise, at large time, the canonical measurement-based lower bound oscillates with a larger amplitude when the initial state of the system undergoing dephasing dynamics is chosen from the nontopological phase, compared to the same for an initial state from the topological phase. On the other hand, repetitive collapses followed by revivals to high value with time are observed for the proposed witness-based lower bound in the nontopological phase, which is absent in the topological phase. These features can be utilized to distinguish the topological phase of the system from the nontopological phase in the presence of dephasing noise.},

  abstract = {Non-Hermiticity enriches topological phases beyond the existing Hermitian framework. Whereas their unusual features with no Hermitian counterparts were extensively explored, a full understanding about the role of symmetry in non-Hermitian physics has still been elusive, and there remains an urgent need to establish their topological classification in view of rapid theoretical and experimental progress. Here, we develop a complete theory of symmetry and topology in non-Hermitian physics. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity ramifies the celebrated Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification for insulators and superconductors. In particular, charge conjugation is defined in terms of transposition rather than complex conjugation due to the lack of Hermiticity, and hence chiral symmetry becomes distinct from sublattice symmetry. It is also shown that non-Hermiticity enables a Hermitian-conjugate counterpart of the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry. Taking into account sublattice symmetry or pseudo-Hermiticity as an additional symmetry, the total number of symmetry classes is 38 instead of 10, which describe intrinsic non-Hermitian topological phases as well as non-Hermitian random matrices. Furthermore, due to the complex nature of energy spectra, non-Hermitian systems feature two different types of complex-energy gaps, pointlike and linelike vacant regions. On the basis of these concepts and K-theory, we complete classification of non-Hermitian topological phases in arbitrary dimensions and symmetry classes. Remarkably, non-Hermitian topology depends on the type of complex-energy gaps, and multiple topological structures appear for each symmetry class and each spatial dimension, which are also illustrated in detail with concrete examples. Moreover, the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems is elucidated within our framework, and symmetries preventing the non-Hermitian skin effect are identified. Our classification not only categorizes recently observed lasing and transport topological phenomena, but also predicts a new type of symmetry-protected topological lasers with lasing helical edge states and dissipative topological superconductors with nonorthogonal Majorana edge states. Furthermore, our theory provides topological classification of Hermitian and non-Hermitian free bosons. Our work establishes a theoretical framework for the fundamental and comprehensive understanding of non-Hermitian topological phases and paves the way toward uncovering unique phenomena and functionalities that emerge from the interplay of non-Hermiticity and topology.},

Here, it is demonstrated that the standard non-Bloch band theory breaks down in the symplectic class, in which non-Hermitian Hamiltonians exhibit Kramers degeneracy because of reciprocity. Instead, a modified non-Bloch band theory for the symplectic class is developed in a general manner, as well as illustrative examples.

For open quantum fermionic systems, we develop the Z4 classification of fermion parity symmetry and antiunitary symmetry in the double Hilbert space, which contrasts with the Z8 classification in closed quantum systems. We also develop the symmetry classification of open quantum fermionic many-body systems—a dissipative generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model described by the Lindblad master equation. We establish the periodic tables of the SYK Lindbladians and elucidate the difference from the SYK Hamiltonians. Furthermore, from extensive numerical calculations, we study its complex-spectral statistics and demonstrate dissipative quantum chaos enriched by symmetry.},

We find high sensitivity to decoherence, increasing with the number of steps in the walk, as the particle is becoming more delocalized with each step. However, the effect of a small amount of decoherence is to enhance the properties of the quantum walk that are desirable for the development of quantum algorithms. Specifically, we observe a highly uniform distribution on the line, a very fast mixing time on the cycle, and more reliable hitting times across the hypercube.},

A physical implementation of a quantum walk (the quantum quincunx) should thus have an identifiable walker and the capacity to demonstrate the interpolation between wave walk and random walk depending on the strength of measurement.},

  abstract = {The development of quantum walks in the context of quantum computation, as generalisations of random walk techniques, has led rapidly to several new quantum algorithms. These all follow a unitary quantum evolution, apart from the final measurement. Since logical qubits in a quantum computer must be protected from decoherence by error correction, there is no need to consider decoherence at the level of algorithms. Nonetheless, enlarging the range of quantum dynamics to include non-unitary evolution provides a wider range of possibilities for tuning the properties of quantum walks. For example, small amounts of decoherence in a quantum walk on the line can produce more uniform spreading (a top-hat distribution), without losing the quantum speed up. This paper reviews the work on decoherence, and more generally on non-unitary evolution, in quantum walks and suggests what future questions might prove interesting to pursue in this area.},

We investigate the interplay between quantum and random dynamics by comparing the resources required, and examining numerically how the level of quantum correlations varies during the walk. We show numerically that the optimal non-unitary quantum walk proceeds such that the quantum correlations are nearly all removed at the point of the final measurement.

Magnetic fields applied at an angle to the XY planes are found to initially stabilize the order by promoting a spin-flop phase with an increased perpendicular antiferromagnetic moment. In higher fields the antiferromagnetic order becomes unstable and a transition occurs to a phase with no long-range order in the (b,c) plane, proposed to be a spin-liquid phase that arises when the quantum fluctuations induced by the noncommuting field become strong enough to overcome ordering tendencies. Magnetization measurements confirm that saturation occurs at much higher fields and that the proposed spin-liquid state exists in the region 2.10},

We perform a systematic analysis of the “isospin” anisotropies, which arise from the valley and sublattice asymmetric short-range electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions. The phase diagram, obtained in the presence of generic isospin anisotropy and the Zeeman effect, consists of four phases characterized by the following orders: spin-polarized ferromagnetic, canted antiferromagnetic, charge density wave, and Kekulé distortion. We take into account the Landau level mixing effects and show that they result in the key renormalizations of parameters. First, the absolute values of the anisotropy energies become greatly enhanced and can significantly exceed the Zeeman energy. Second, the signs of the anisotropy energies due to e-e interactions can change upon renormalization. A crucial consequence of the latter is that the short-range e-e interactions alone could favor any state on the phase diagram, depending on the details of interactions at the lattice scale. On the other hand, the leading e-ph interactions always favor the Kekulé distortion order. The possibility of inducing phase transitions by tilting the magnetic field is discussed.},

In particular, we demonstrate that recent experimental realizations of quantum walks with cold atoms, photons, and ions simulate a nontrivial one-dimensional topological phase. With simple modifications, the quantum walk can be engineered to realize all of the topological phases, which have been classified in one and two dimensions.

Using this picture, we provide an intuitive understanding of the well-known phenomenon of quantized adiabatic pumping. Systems whose Floquet operators belong to the trivial class simulate the dynamics generated by time-independent Hamiltonians, which can be topologically classified according to the schemes developed for static systems. We demonstrate these principles through an example of a periodically driven two-dimensional hexagonal lattice tight-binding model which exhibits several topological phases.

This robustness has applications in metrology and holds promise for future uses in quantum computing. Engineered quantum systems—notably in photonics, where wavefunctions can be observed directly—provide versatile platforms for creating and probing a variety of topological phases. Here we use photonic quantum walks to observe bound states between systems with different bulk topological properties and demonstrate their robustness to perturbations—a signature of topological protection. Although such bound states are usually discussed for static (time-independent) systems, here we demonstrate their existence in an explicitly time-dependent situation. Moreover, we discover a new phenomenon: a topologically protected pair of bound states unique to periodically driven systems.},

Unlike full quantum state tomography, the protocol can be implemented on near-term quantum hardware and requires few quantum measurements to make many predictions with a high success probability. In this paper, we study the effects of noise on the classical shadows protocol. In particular, we consider the scenario in which the quantum circuits involved in the protocol are subject to various known noise channels and derive an analytical upper bound for the sample complexity in terms of a shadow seminorm for both local and global noise. Additionally, by modifying the classical post-processing step of the noiseless protocol, we define a new estimator that remains unbiased in the presence of noise. As applications, we show that our results can be used to prove rigorous sample complexity upper bounds in the cases of depolarizing noise and amplitude damping.},

  abstract = {We develop a topological classification of non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians that depend on momentum and frequency. Such effective Hamiltonians are in one-to-one correspondence to single-particle Green's functions of systems that satisfy translational invariance in space and time but may be interacting or open. We employ K theory, which for the special case of noninteracting systems leads to the well-known 10-fold-way topological classification of insulators and fully gapped superconductors. Relevant theorems for K groups are reformulated and proven in the more transparent language of Hamiltonians instead of vector bundles. We obtain 54 symmetry classes for frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians satisfying antiunitary symmetries. Employing dimensional reduction, the group structure for all these classes is calculated. This classification leads to a group structure with one component from the momentum dependence, which corresponds to the non-Hermitian generalization of topological insulators and superconductors, and two additional parts resulting from the frequency dependence. These parts describe winding of the effective Hamiltonian in the frequency direction and in combined momentum-frequency space.},

  abstract = {Non-Hermitian systems exhibit striking exceptions from the paradigmatic bulk-boundary correspondence, including the failure of bulk Bloch band invariants in predicting boundary states and the (dis)appearance of boundary states at parameter values far from those corresponding to gap closings in periodic systems without boundaries. Here, we provide a comprehensive framework to unravel this disparity based on the notion of biorthogonal quantum mechanics: While the properties of the left and right eigenstates corresponding to boundary modes are individually decoupled from the bulk physics in non-Hermitian systems, their combined biorthogonal density penetrates the bulk precisely when phase transitions occur. This leads to generalized bulk-boundary correspondence and a quantized biorthogonal polarization that is formulated directly in systems with open boundaries. We illustrate our general insights by deriving the phase diagram for several microscopic open boundary models, including exactly solvable non-Hermitian extensions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and Chern insulators.},

We prove that the non-Hermitian counterpart is characterized by a point-gap topological invariant, and furthermore, that the invariant exactly matches that of the corresponding Hermitian anomalous boundary mode. We thus establish a correspondence between the topological classifications of (d+1)-dimensional gapped Hermitian systems and d-dimensional point-gapped non-Hermitian systems.

For non-hermitian operators we in addition need to specify the type of spectral gap. They come in the flavor of a point gap or a line gap. Since the presence of a line gap implies the existence of a point gap, there is usually more than one mathematical classification applicable to a physical system. That raises the question: which of these gap-type classifications is physically meaningful? To decide this question, I propose a simple criterion, namely the choice of physically relevant states. This generalizes the notion of Fermi projection that plays a crucial role in the topological classification of fermionic condensed matter systems, and enters as an auxiliary quantity in the bulk classification of photonic and magnonic crystals. After that the classification is entirely algorithmic, the system's topology is encoded in (pairs of) projections with symmetries and constraints. A crucial point in my investigation is the relevance of diagonalizability. Even for existing topological classifications of non-hermitian systems diagonalizability needs to be assumed to ensure that continuous deformations of the hamiltonian lead to continuous deformations of the spectra, projections and unitaries.},

Nonetheless, employment of machine learning for wave function representations is focused on more traditional architectures such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and fully connected neural networks. In this Letter, we establish that contemporary deep learning architectures, in the form of deep convolutional and recurrent networks, can efficiently represent highly entangled quantum systems. By constructing tensor network equivalents of these architectures, we identify an inherent reuse of information in the network operation as a key trait which distinguishes them from standard tensor network-based representations, and which enhances their entanglement capacity. Our results show that such architectures can support volume-law entanglement scaling, polynomially more efficiently than presently employed RBMs. Thus, beyond a quantification of the entanglement capacity of leading deep learning architectures, our analysis formally motivates a shift of trending neural-network-based wave function representations closer to the state-of-the-art in machine learning.},

  abstract = {Quantum walks have emerged as an interesting approach to implementing quantum information processing task in recent years. In this work, we take advantage of the properties of quantum walks to design a novel kind of flexible and conclusive quantum teleportation scheme of multiple arbitrary qubits. First, two-walker quantum walks on three types of quantum structures, the line, the cycle and two-vertice complete graph with loops, are utilized to accomplish the teleportation of an arbitrary 2-qubit state. Second, without loss of generality, a generalization for teleporting an arbitrary N-qubit state is also shown by N-walker quantum walks on two-vertice complete graph with loops. Our scheme has two merits. (i) Three different quantum-walk structures can be used to teleport an arbitrary N-qubit state, which means that one can implement the scheme flexibly, depending on the concrete experimental environment. (ii) The prior entangled state is not necessarily prepared, as multiple-walker quantum walks may contain entanglement. In addition, the single-particle projective measurement and single-qubit gate are required, rather than a joint measurement and controlled-NOT gate, which will possibly simplify experimental realizations of this scheme. This work stimulates us to explore more potential applications of multi-walker quantum walks.},

We develop an experimental protocol of pump-probe quench measurement to probe, with minimal heating, the resonant spin flipping on a particular quasimomentum subspace called band-inversion surfaces. With this protocol we demonstrate Dirac-type 2D SO coupling in a fermionic system, and detect nontrivial band topology by observing the change of band-inversion surfaces as the two-photon detuning varies. The nontrivial band topology is also observed by slowly loading the atoms into optical Raman lattices and measuring the spin textures. Our results show solid evidence for the realization of the minimal SO-coupled quantum anomalous Hall model, which can provide a feasible platform to investigate novel topological physics including the correlation effects with SO-coupled ultracold fermions.},

We propose that these symmetries are relevant for the topological classification of non-Hermitian single-particle Hamiltonians and Hermitian bosonic Bogoliubov–de Gennes (BdG) models. We show that the spectrum of any Hermitian bosonic BdG Hamiltonian is found by solving for the eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian matrix which belongs to one of the BL classes.

When the graph is both connected and regular, it is shown that the steady state is the maximally mixed state. As shown by the examples in this article, the steady states of CTOQW can be very unusual and complicated even though the underlying graphs are simple. The examples demonstrate that the structure of a graph can affect quantum coherence in CTOQW through a long-time run. Precisely, the quantum coherence persists throughout the evolution of the CTOQW when the underlying topology is certain irregular graphs (such as a path or a star as shown in the examples). In contrast, the quantum coherence will eventually vanish from the open quantum system when the underlying topology is a regular graph (such as a cycle).},

While the non-Hermitian system with a point gap belongs to any of 38 symmetry classes (Bernard-LeClair classes), for non-Hermitian systems with a linelike gap, we get 54 nonequivalent generalized Bernard-LeClair classes as a natural generalization of point gap classes. Although the classification of defects in Hermitian systems has been explored in the context of the standard tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, a complete understanding of the role of the general non-Hermitian symmetries on the topological defects and their associated classification is still lacking. By continuous transformation and homeomorphic mapping, these non-Hermitian defect systems can be mapped to topologically equivalent Hermitian systems with associated symmetries, and we get the topological classification by classifying the corresponding Hermitian Hamiltonians. We discuss some nontrivial classes with a point gap according to our classification table and give explicitly the topological invariants for these classes. We also study some lattice or continuous models and discuss the correspondence between the topological number and zero modes at the topological defect.},

For the open system with the corresponding damping matrix exhibiting Z2 skin effect, we identify the existence of helical damping, characterized by the evolution of relative particle number with exponentially and algebraically decreasing intervals distinguished by sharp wave fronts with opposite propagation directions. When the time-reversal symmetry is broken by adding perturbations, we find the occurrence of dynamical critical skin effect, which causes the disappearance of the helical damping in the thermodynamic limit although it can survive in small size systems. We also demonstrate the existence of anomalous critical skin effect when we couple two identical systems with Z2 skin effect. With the help of non-Bloch band theory, we unveil that the change of generalized Brillouin zone equation is the origin of critical skin effect.},

  abstract = {Unidirectional and robust transport is generally observed at the edge of two- or three-dimensional quantum Hall and topological insulator systems. A hallmark of these systems is topological protection, i.e., the existence of propagative edge states that cannot be scattered by imperfections or disorder in the system. A different and less explored form of robust transport arises in non-Hermitian systems in the presence of an imaginary gauge field. As compared to topologically protected transport in quantum Hall and topological insulator systems, robust non-Hermitian transport can be observed in lower dimensional (i.e., one dimensional) systems. In this work the transport properties of one-dimensional tight-binding lattices with an imaginary gauge field are theoretically investigated, and the physical mechanism underlying robust one-way transport is highlighted. Back scattering is here forbidden because reflected waves are evanescent rather than propagative. Remarkably, the spectral transmission of the non-Hermitian lattice is shown to be mapped onto the one of the corresponding Hermitian lattice, i.e., without the gauge field, but computed in the complex plane. In particular, at large values of the gauge field the spectral transmittance becomes equal to 1, even in the presence of disorder or lattice imperfections. This phenomenon can be referred to as one-way non-Hermitian transparency. Robust one-way transport can be also realized in a more realistic setting, namely in heterostructure systems, in which a non-Hermitian disordered lattice is embedded between two homogeneous Hermitian lattices. Such a double heterostructure realizes asymmetric (nonreciprocal) wave transmission. A physical implementation of non-Hermitian transparency, based on light transport in a chain of optical microring resonators, is suggested.},

  abstract = {As discovered by P. W. Anderson, excitations do not propagate freely in a disordered lattice, but, due to destructive interference, they localise. As a consequence, when an atom interacts with a disordered lattice, one indeed observes a non-trivial excitation exchange between atom and lattice. Such non-trivial atomic dynamics will in general be characterised also by a non-trivial quantum information backflow, a clear signature of non-Markovian dynamics. To investigate the above scenario, we consider a quantum emitter, or atom, weakly coupled to a uniform coupled-cavity array (CCA). If initially excited, in the absence of disorder, the emitter undergoes a Markovian spontaneous emission by releasing all its excitation into the CCA (initially in its vacuum state). By introducing static disorder in the CCA the field normal modes become Anderson-localized, giving rise to a non-Markovian atomic dynamics. We show the existence of a functional relationship between a rigorous measure of quantum non-Markovianity and the CCA localization. We furthermore show that the average non-Markovianity of the atomic dynamics is well-described by a phenomenological model in which the atom is coupled, at the same time, to a single mode and to a standard - Markovian - dissipative bath.},

These phases have been demonstrated for electronic systems, electromagnetic waves1–5, cold atoms6,7, acoustics8 and even mechanics9, and their potential applications include spintronics, quantum computing and highly efficient lasers10–12. Typically, the model describing topological insulators is a spatial lattice in two or three dimensions. However, topological edge states have~also been observed in a lattice with one spatial dimension and one synthetic dimension (corresponding to the spin modes of an ultracold atom13–15), and atomic modes have been used as synthetic dimensions to demonstrate lattice models and physical phenomena that are not accessible to experiments in spatial lattices13,16,17. In photonics, topological lattices with synthetic dimensions have been proposed for the study of physical phenomena in high dimensions and interacting photons18–22, but so far photonic topological insulators in synthetic dimensions have not been observed. Here we demonstrate experimentally a photonic topological insulator in synthetic dimensions. We fabricate a photonic lattice in which photons are subjected to an effective magnetic field in a space with one spatial dimension and one synthetic modal dimension. Our scheme supports topological edge states in this spatial-modal lattice, resulting in a robust topological state that extends over the bulk of a two-dimensional real-space lattice. Our system can be used to increase the dimensionality of a photonic lattice and induce long-range coupling by design, leading to lattice models that can be used to study unexplored physical phenomena.},

In condensed matter physics, studies often are restricted to first-neighbor particles. In this work, we consider the one-dimensional XXZ model in a transverse magnetic field (TF) which is not integrable except at specific points. Analytical expressions for quantum correlations (entanglement and quantum discord) between spin pairs at any distance are obtained for both zero and finite temperature by using the analytical approach proposed by Caux et al. [Phys. Rev. B 68, 134431 (2003)]. We compare the efficiency of the quantum discord (QD) with respect to the entanglement in the detection of critical points as the neighboring spin pairs go farther than the next-nearest neighbors. In the absence of the TF and at zero temperature, we show that the QD for spin pairs farther than the second neighbors is able to capture the critical points while the pairwise entanglement is absent. In contrast with the pairwise entanglement, two-site QD is effectively long range in the critical regimes where it decays algebraically with the distance between pairs. We also show that the thermal QD between neighbor spins possesses strong distinctive behavior at the critical point that can be seen at finite temperature and, therefore, spotlights the critical point while the entanglement fails in this task.},

However, no local marker for interacting matter has been proposed yet that is capable of directly addressing an interacting system. Here, we suggest such a many-body local marker based on the single-particle Green's function. Using this marker we identify topological transitions in finite lattices of a Chern insulator with Anderson disorder and Hubbard interactions. Importantly, our proposal can be generalized to nonequilibrium systems.},

The mapping allows us to engineer and study temporal analogs of many real-space phenomena. Here, we focus on the specific example of a two-level system under a two-frequency drive that induces topologically nontrivial band structure in the 2D Floquet space. The observable consequence of such a construction is the quantized pumping of energy between the sources with frequencies ω1 and ω2.

Inspired by this, we show how the behavioral choice-probabilities can arise as the unique stationary distribution of quantum stochastic walkers on the classical network defined from Luce’s response probabilities. This work is relevant because (i) we provide a very general framework integrating the positive characteristics of both quantum and classical approaches previously in confrontation and (ii) we define a cognitive network which can be used to bring other connectivist approaches to decision-making into the quantum stochastic realm. We model the decision-maker as an open system in contact with her surrounding environment and the time-length of the decision-making process reveals to be also a measure of the process’ degree of interplay between the unitary and irreversible dynamics. Implementing quantum coherence on classical networks may be a door to better integrate human-like reasoning biases in stochastic models for decision-making.},

Irrespective of the microscopic symmetries, interactions between a quantum system and its surroundings facilitate processes that would be forbidden by TRS in an isolated system. This leads not only to entanglement entropy production and the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility7–9, but also to the demise of TRS-protected phenomena, including those associated with certain symmetry-protected topological phases. Our results highlight the enigmatic nature of TRS in quantum mechanics and elucidate potential challenges in utilizing topological systems for quantum technologies.},

Lattice relaxation of any spins, whether or not they belong to the species being observed, causes fluctuations in the local fields and so destroys the relations between precessional phases which lead to the generation of echoes. The effect of these fluctuations on the echo amplitude can be calculated by taking an ensemble average for the precessing spins and for all the environmental spins which give rise to significant time variations of the local fields in the sample. The problem reduces to that of finding a time and a space average. The space average has been obtained here by assuming a random distribution of spins in the paramagnetic sample, and by applying the statistical methods of Margenau. In order to obtain the time average, two models have been chosen to represent the time variation of the components μz for the relaxing spins. In one model, the μz are treated as Gaussian random variables (Gauss-Markoff model), and in the other the spins are assumed to make sudden jumps at random times between the "spin-up" and "spin-down" quantum states (sudden-jump model). Different forms of echo envelope are derived for the two models. Further differences in behavior will be observed, according to whether the sample is singly or doubly doped. If the sample contains only one spin species, TM becames shorter as the temperature is raised and as the lattice relaxation time T1 is reduced. Initially, TM is limited by local field fluctuations and may be considerably shorter than T1. Eventually, as the lattice relaxation of the precessing spins themselves becomes the dominant factor, T1 and TM tend to the same value. If the sample contains two species A and B, where B relaxes more rapidly than A, then TM(A) and TM(B) both begin by shortening as T1(B) is reduced. For very small values of T1(B), however, TM(A) lengthens again. The rapidly fluctuating local fields due to the B-spins produce a diminishing effect on the A spins, the phenomenon being analogous to motional narrowing. The form of the A-spin echo envelope in the limit of rapid B-spin relaxation does not depend on the model chosen to represent the time variation of μz during the relaxation of the B spins.},

To fulfil this promise, efficient and general methods are needed to discover and classify new topological phases of matter. We demonstrate that deep neural networks augmented with external memory can use the density profiles formed in quantum walks to efficiently identify properties of a topological phase as well as phase transitions. On a trial topological ordered model, our method’s accuracy of topological phase identification reaches 97.4\%, and is shown to be robust to noise on the data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our trained DNN is able to identify topological phases of a perturbed model, and predict the corresponding shift of topological phase transitions without learning any information about the perturbations in advance. These results demonstrate that our approach is generally applicable and may be used to identify a variety of quantum topological materials.},

Moreover, when reciprocity is broken in a photonic topological insulator, these states provide protection against disorder, which is of particular importance for slow-light applications. Achieving such a one-way edge state, however, requires the construction of a two-dimensional structure. Here, we show how unidiriectional Floquet bands can arise in purely one-dimensional, adiabatically modulated dynamic systems, in contrast with the higher dimensionality needed in topological insulators. We also show that, using realistic experimental parameters, the concept can be implemented using both a coupled-resonator optical waveguide and a photonic-crystal waveguide. Furthermore, we illustrate the associated protection against disorder and find it to be of a different nature when compared to Floquet topological insulators.},

  abstract = {Exceptional points are branch point singularities in the parameter space of a system at which two or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, coalesce and become degenerate. Such peculiar degeneracies are distinct features of non-Hermitian systems, which do not obey conservation laws because they exchange energy with the surrounding environment. Non-Hermiticity has been of great interest in recent years, particularly in connection with the quantum mechanical notion of parity-time symmetry, after the realization that Hamiltonians satisfying this special symmetry can exhibit entirely real spectra. These concepts have become of particular interest in photonics because optical gain and loss can be integrated and controlled with high resolution in nanoscale structures, realizing an ideal playground for non-Hermitian physics, parity-time symmetry, and exceptional points. As we control dissipation and amplification in a nanophotonic system, the emergence of exceptional point singularities dramatically alters their overall response, leading to a range of exotic optical functionalities associated with abrupt phase transitions in the eigenvalue spectrum. These concepts enable ultrasensitive measurements, superior manipulation of the modal content of multimode lasers, and adiabatic control of topological energy transfer for mode and polarization conversion. Non-Hermitian degeneracies have also been exploited in exotic laser systems, new nonlinear optics schemes, and exotic scattering features in open systems. Here we review the opportunities offered by exceptional point physics in photonics, discuss recent developments in theoretical and experimental research based on photonic exceptional points, and examine future opportunities in this area from basic science to applied technology.},

Recently, direct evidence of long-lived coherence has been experimentally demonstrated for the dynamics of the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) protein complex [Engel et al., Nature (London)\hphantom{,}446, 782 (2007)]. However, the relevance of quantum dynamical processes to the exciton transfer efficiency is to a large extent unknown. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for studying the role of quantum interference effects in energy transfer dynamics of molecular arrays interacting with a thermal bath within the Lindblad formalism. To this end, we generalize continuous-time quantum walks to nonunitary and temperature-dependent dynamics in Liouville space derived from a microscopic Hamiltonian. Different physical effects of coherence and decoherence processes are explored via a universal measure for the energy transfer efficiency and its susceptibility. In particular, we demonstrate that for the FMO complex, an effective interplay between the free Hamiltonian evolution and the thermal fluctuations in the environment leads to a substantial increase in energy transfer efficiency from about 70\% to 99\%.},

Recently, a generalization of this quantity to open systems—known as the ensemble geometric phase (EGP)—has emerged as a robust way to describe topology at nonzero temperature. By using this quantity, we explore the nature of topology allowed for dissipation beyond a Lindblad description, to allow for coupling to external baths at finite temperatures. We introduce two main aspects to the theory of open-system topology. First, we discover topological phase transitions as a function of the temperature T, manifesting as changes in differences of the EGP accumulated over a closed loop in parameter space. We characterize the nature of these transitions and reveal that the corresponding nonequilibrium steady state can exhibit a nontrivial structure—contrary to previous studies where it was found to be in a fully mixed state. Second, we demonstrate that the EGP itself becomes quantized when key symmetries are present, allowing it to be viewed as a topological marker which can undergo equilibrium topological transitions at nonzero temperatures.},

This finding resolves an apparent discrepancy reported in the literature between the inverse of the Liouvillian gap and the relaxation time in dissipative many-body quantum systems.},

Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical concepts of maps, vector spaces, and topology. The following chapters focus on more elaborate concepts in geometry and topology and discuss the application of these concepts to liquid crystals, superfluid helium, general relativity, and bosonic string theory. Later chapters unify geometry and topology, exploring fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and index theorems. New to this second edition is the proof of the index theorem in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The final two chapters are devoted to the most fascinating applications of geometry and topology in contemporary physics, namely the study of anomalies in gauge field theories and the analysis of Polakov's bosonic string theory from the geometrical point of view.Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition is an ideal introduction to differential geometry and topology for postgraduate students and researchers in theoretical and mathematical physics.},

  abstract = {Topological quantum computation has emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as non-Abelian anyons, meaning that they obey non-Abelian braiding statistics. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations that are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles and then measuring the multiquasiparticle states. The fault tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the nonlocal encoding of the quasiparticle states, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the ν=5∕2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and thin-film superconductors. In this review article, current research in this field is described, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. Both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject are addressed, using the ν=5∕2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

The method allows for simulating the time evolution of open quantum systems with arbitrary spectral densities at zero or finite temperatures with controllable and certified error. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method towards the simulation of quintessential fermionic open quantum systems including the resonant-level model and quantum dot coupled to an impurity and towards simulating hitherto intractable problems in quantum transport. Furthermore, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains in the computational costs by performing simulations in the Heisenberg picture. Finally, we compare different approaches for simulating finite-temperature situations and provide practical guidelines in order to identify the best strategy.},

The anomalous phase transition is complementary to the universal non-Bloch wave behavior of non-Hermitian systems. We show that an infinite small magnetic field drastically suppresses the non-Hermitian skin effect, inducing a topological phase with Majorana boundary states. Furthermore, by identifying the bulk topological invariant, we establish the non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence that does not have a Hermitian counterpart.

Among them, the bulk-boundary correspondence is the central topic in topological physics, which has inspired researchers to focus on boundary physics. Recently, the concepts of topological phases have been extended to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose eigenvalues can be complex. Besides the topology, non-Hermiticity can also cause a boundary phenomenon called the non-Hermitian skin effect, which is an extreme sensitivity of the spectrum to the boundary condition. In this article, we review developments in non-Hermitian topological physics by focusing mainly on the boundary problem. As well as the competition between non-Hermitian and topological boundary phenomena, we discuss the topological nature inherent in non-Hermiticity itself.},

Consequentially, seeking new driving protocols that allow for more exotic topological phases and transitions becomes imperative for the Floquet engineer. In this paper, we study the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model driven by two time-dependent periodic sources with commensurate frequencies and an amplitude modulation. Imposing more than one driving frequency allows us to realize even more exotic topological phases resulting from new couplings appearing in the Fourier space representation. Moreover, we find an experimentally practical method for sweeping the system through a topological phase transition by varying the amplitude mixture of the commensurate sources. We employ the local Chern marker, a real-space representation of the Chern number, to simulate topological phase diagrams of the two-drive Floquet Hamiltonian in a variety of driving cases.},

Nevertheless, fully integrating photonic chips that include quantum light sources, effective manipulation and transport of light minimizing losses, and appropriate detection systems remains an ongoing challenge. Topological photonic systems have emerged as promising platforms to protect quantum light properties during propagation, beyond merely preserving light intensity. In this work, we delve into the dynamics of non-classical light traversing a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattice with topological domain walls. Our focus centers on how topology influences the quantum properties of light as it moves across the array. By precisely adjusting the spacing between waveguides, we achieve dynamic repositioning and interaction of domain walls, facilitating effective beam-splitting operations. Our findings demonstrate high-fidelity transport of non-classical light across the lattice, replicating known results that are now safeguarded by the topology of the system. This protection is especially beneficial for quantum communication protocols with continuous variable states. Our study enhances the understanding of light dynamics in topological photonic systems and paves the way for high-fidelity, topology-protected quantum communication.},

As an illustration, we extract the quantum metric of the multiband Hofstadter model. Moreover, we demonstrate how this method can be used to directly probe the spread functional, a quantity which sets the lower bound on the spread of Wannier functions and signals phase transitions. Our proposal offers a universal probe for quantum geometry, which could be readily applied in a wide range of physical settings, ranging from superconducting quantum circuits to ultracold atomic gases.},

This approach provides a way to engineer lattice Hamiltonians and enables the realization of higher-dimensional topological models in platforms with lower dimensionality.

This is achieved by locally coupling a two-dimensional L×L toric code to a three-dimensional (3D) bath of bosons hopping on a cubic lattice. When the stabilizer operators of the toric code are coupled to the displacement operator of the bosons, we solve the model exactly via a polaron transformation and show that the energy penalty to create anyons grows linearly with L. When the stabilizer operators of the toric code are coupled to the bosonic density operator, we use perturbation theory to show that the energy penalty for anyons scales with ln(L). For a given error model, these energy penalties lead to a lifetime of the stored quantum information growing, respectively, exponentially and polynomially with L. Furthermore, we show how to choose an appropriate coupling scheme in order to hinder the hopping of anyons (and not only their creation) with energy barriers that are of the same order as the anyon creation gaps. We argue that a toric code coupled to a 3D Heisenberg ferromagnet realizes our model in its low-energy sector. Finally, we discuss the delicate issue of the stability of topological order in the presence of perturbations. While we do not derive a rigorous proof of topological order, we present heuristic arguments suggesting that topological order remains intact when perturbative operators acting on the toric code spins are coupled to the bosonic environment.},

In this article we present a natural continuous time extension of these Open Quantum Random Walks. This continuous time version is obtained by taking a continuous time limit of the discrete time Open Quantum Random Walks. This approximation procedure is based on some adaptation of Repeated Quantum Interactions Theory (Attal and Pautrat in Annales Henri Poincaré Physique Théorique 7:59–104, 2006) coupled with the use of correlated projectors (Breuer in Phys Rev A 75:022103, 2007). The limit evolutions obtained this way give rise to a particular type of quantum master equations. These equations appeared originally in the non-Markovian generalization of the Lindblad theory (Breuer in Phys Rev A 75:022103, 2007). We also investigate the continuous time limits of the quantum trajectories associated with Open Quantum Random Walks. We show that the limit evolutions in this context are described by jump stochastic differential equations. Finally we present a physical example which can be described in terms of Open Quantum Random Walks and their associated continuous time limits.},

Here we consider low-energy quantum mechanics in the presence of gravitational time dilation and show that the latter leads to the decoherence of quantum superpositions. Time dilation induces a universal coupling between the internal degrees of freedom and the centre of mass of a composite particle. The resulting correlations lead to decoherence in the particle position, even without any external environment. We also show that the weak time dilation on Earth is already sufficient to affect micrometre-scale objects. Gravity can therefore account for the emergence of classicality and this effect could in principle be tested in future matter-wave experiments.},

  abstract = {The staggered quantum-walk model makes it possible to establish an unprecedented connection between discrete-time quantum walks and graph theory. We call attention to the fact that a large subclass of the coined model is included in Szegedy's model, which in its turn is entirely included in the staggered model. In order to compare those three quantum-walk models, we put them in the staggered formalism and show that the Szegedy and coined models are defined on a special subclass of graphs. This inclusion scheme is also true when the searching framework is added. We use graph theory to characterize which staggered quantum walks can be reduced to the Szegedy or coined quantum-walk model. We analyze a staggered-based search that cannot be included in Szegedy's model and show numerically that this search is more efficient than a random-walk-based search.},

The solution in a classical computer requires N queries because it uses sorting to check whether there are equal elements. In the quantum case, it is possible to solve the problem in \$\$O(N\textasciicircum\{2/3\})\$\$queries. There is an extension which asks whether there are k colliding elements, known as element k-distinctness problem. This work obtains optimal values of two critical parameters of Ambainis’ seminal quantum algorithm (SIAM J Comput 37(1):210–239, 2007). The first critical parameter is the number of repetitions of the algorithm’s main block, which inverts the phase of the marked elements and calls a subroutine. The second parameter is the number of quantum walk steps interlaced by oracle queries. We show that, when the optimal values of the parameters are used, the algorithm’s success probability is \$\$1-O(N\textasciicircum\{1/(k+1)\})\$\$, quickly approaching 1. The specification of the exact running time and success probability is important in practical applications of this algorithm.},

From quantum electrodynamics through unified theories of the interactions among leptons and quarks, Chris Quigg examines the logic and structure behind gauge theories and the experimental underpinnings of today's theories. Quigg emphasizes how we know what we know, and in the era of the Large Hadron Collider, his insightful survey of the standard model and the next great questions for particle physics makes for compelling reading.The brand-new edition shows how the electroweak theory developed in conversation with experiment. Featuring a wide-ranging treatment of electroweak symmetry breaking, the physics of the Higgs boson, and the importance of the 1-TeV scale, the book moves beyond established knowledge and investigates the path toward unified theories of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. Explicit calculations and diverse exercises allow readers to derive the consequences of these theories. Extensive annotated bibliographies accompany each chapter, amplify points of conceptual or technical interest, introduce further applications, and lead readers to the research literature. Students and seasoned practitioners will profit from the text's current insights, and specialists wishing to understand gauge theories will find the book an ideal reference for self-study.

  abstract = {The steady states of dynamical processes can exhibit stable nontrivial phases, which can also serve as fault-tolerant classical or quantum memories. For Markovian quantum (classical) dynamics, these steady states are extremal eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian operators that generate the dynamics, i.e., quantum channels (Markov chains). However, since these operators are non-Hermitian, their spectra are an unreliable guide to dynamical relaxation timescales or to stability against perturbations. We propose an alternative dynamical criterion for a steady state to be in a stable phase, which we name uniformity: informally, our criterion amounts to requiring that, under sufficiently small local perturbations of the dynamics, the unperturbed and perturbed steady states are related to one another by a finite-time dissipative evolution. We show that this criterion implies many of the properties one would want from any reasonable definition of a phase. We prove that uniformity is satisfied in a canonical classical cellular automaton, and provide numerical evidence that the gap determines the relaxation rate between nearby steady states in the same phase, a situation we conjecture holds generically whenever uniformity is satisfied. We further conjecture some sufficient conditions for a channel to exhibit uniformity and therefore stability.},

We consider two classes of one-dimensional quantum walks and connect the global phase imprinted on the walker with its refocusing behavior. By disentangling the dynamical and geometric contributions to this phase, we describe a general strategy to measure the topological invariant in these quantum walks. As an example, we propose an experimental protocol in a circuit QED architecture where a superconducting transmon qubit plays the role of the coin, while the quantum walk takes place in the phase space of a cavity.},

We find a topological transition in this model even in the case of non-Markovian evolution where the walker may visit the reservoir and return to the SSH lattice at a later time. The existence of a topological transition does, however, depend on the low-frequency properties of the reservoir, characterized by a spectral density J(ϵ) ∝ |ϵ|α. In particular, we find a robust topological transition for a sub-Ohmic (α {$<$} 1) and Ohmic (α = 1) reservoir, but no topological transition for a super-Ohmic (α {$>$} 1) reservoir. This behavior is directly related to the well-known localization transition for the spin-boson model.

We demonstrate that symmetry can lead to self-correction in 3D spin-lattice models. In particular, we investigate codes given by 2D symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases that appear naturally on the boundary of 3D symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. We find that while conventional on-site symmetries are not sufficient to allow for self-correction in commuting Hamiltonian models of this form, a generalized type of symmetry known as a 1-form symmetry is enough to guarantee self-correction. We illustrate this fact with the 3D “cluster-state” model from the theory of quantum computing. This model is a self-correcting memory, where information is encoded in a 2D SET-ordered phase on the boundary that is protected by the thermally stable SPT ordering of the bulk. We also investigate the gauge color code in this context. Finally, noting that a 1-form symmetry is a very strong constraint, we argue that topologically ordered systems can possess emergent 1-form symmetries, i.e., models where the symmetry appears naturally, without needing to be enforced externally.},

To characterize the system, the Hall drift of the employed atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in the lowest Landau-like level is determined. The topological properties are verified by determining the local Chern marker, and upon performing low-lying excitations both cyclotron and skipping orbits are observed in the bulk and edges, respectively. Future prospects include studies of novel topological phases in cold-atom systems.},

  abstract = {The classical shadows protocol is an efficient strategy for estimating properties of an unknown state \$\textbackslash rho\$ using a small number of state copies and measurements. In its original form, it involves twirling the state with unitaries from some ensemble and measuring the twirled state in a fixed basis. It was recently shown that for computing local properties, optimal sample complexity (copies of the state required) is remarkably achieved for unitaries drawn from shallow depth circuits composed of local entangling gates, as opposed to purely local (zero depth) or global twirling (infinite depth) ensembles. Here we consider the sample complexity as a function of the depth of the circuit, in the presence of noise. We find that this noise has important implications for determining the optimal twirling ensemble. Under fairly general conditions, we i) show that any single-site noise can be accounted for using a depolarizing noise channel with an appropriate damping parameter \$f\$; ii) compute thresholds \$f\_\{\textbackslash text\{th\}\}\$ at which optimal twirling reduces to local twirling for arbitrary operators and iii) \$n\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash text\{th\}\}\$ order Renyi entropies (\$n \textbackslash ge 2\$); and iv) provide a meaningful upper bound \$t\_\{\textbackslash text\{max\}\}\$ on the optimal circuit depth for any finite noise strength \$f\$, which applies to all operators and entanglement entropy measurements. These thresholds strongly constrain the search for optimal strategies to implement shadow tomography and can be easily tailored to the experimental system at hand.},

  abstract = {It has recently been shown that in every spatial dimension there exist precisely five distinct classes of topological insulators or superconductors. Within a given class, the different topological sectors can be distinguished, depending on the case, by a or a topological invariant. This is an exhaustive classification. Here we construct representatives of topological insulators and superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary spatial dimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians. Using these representatives we demonstrate how topological insulators (superconductors) in different dimensions and different classes can be related via ‘dimensional reduction’ by compactifying one or more spatial dimensions (in ‘Kaluza–Klein’-like fashion). For -topological insulators (superconductors) this proceeds by descending by one dimension at a time into a different class. The -topological insulators (superconductors), on the other hand, are shown to be lower-dimensional descendants of parent -topological insulators in the same class, from which they inherit their topological properties. The eightfold periodicity in dimension d that exists for topological insulators (superconductors) with Hamiltonians satisfying at least one reality condition (arising from time-reversal or charge-conjugation/particle–hole symmetries) is a reflection of the eightfold periodicity of the spinor representations of the orthogonal groups SO(N) (a form of Bott periodicity). Furthermore, we derive for general spatial dimensions a relation between the topological invariant that characterizes topological insulators and superconductors with chiral symmetry (i.e., the winding number) and the Chern–Simons invariant. For lower-dimensional cases, this formula relates the winding number to the electric polarization (d=1 spatial dimensions) or to the magnetoelectric polarizability (d=3 spatial dimensions). Finally, we also discuss topological field theories describing the spacetime theory of linear responses in topological insulators (superconductors) and study how the presence of inversion symmetry modifies the classification of topological insulators (superconductors).},

The concepts of fractionalization and emergent gauge fields are introduced using the simplest resonating valence bond insulator with an energy gap, the Z2 spin liquid. Concepts in band topology and the parton method are then combined to obtain a large variety of experimentally relevant gapped states. Correlated metallic states are described, beginning with a discussion of the Kondo effect on magnetic impurities in metals. Metals without quasiparticle excitations are introduced using the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, followed by a discussion of critical Fermi surfaces and strange metals.

By Floquet engineering the quantum-walk protocol, an Aharonov-Bohm geometric phase is imprinted onto closed-loop paths in the lattice, thus realizing an Abelian gauge field, the analog of a magnetic flux threading a two-dimensional electron gas. We show that in the strong-field regime, when the flux per plaquette is a sizable fraction of the flux quantum, magnetic quantum walks give rise to nearly flat energy bands featuring nonvanishing Chern numbers. Furthermore, we find that because of the nonperturbative nature of the periodic driving, a second topological number, the so-called RLBL invariant, is necessary to fully characterize the anomalous Floquet topological phases of magnetic quantum walks and to compute the number of topologically protected edge modes expected at the boundaries between different phases. In the second part of this paper, we discuss an implementation of this scheme using neutral atoms in two-dimensional spin-dependent optical lattices, which enables the generation of arbitrary magnetic-field landscapes, including those with sharp boundaries. The robust atom transport, which is observed along boundaries separating regions of different field strength, reveals the topological character of the Floquet Chern bands.},

Our approach builds on two main ingredients: (1) a constriction optical potential, which generates a mesoscopic channel connected to two reservoirs, and (2) a time-periodic modulation of the channel specifically designed to generate motion along an additional synthetic dimension. This fictitious dimension is spanned by the harmonic oscillator modes associated with the tightly confined channel, and hence, the corresponding “lattice sites” are intimately related to the energy of the system. We analyze the quantum-transport properties of this hybrid two-dimensional system, highlighting the appealing features offered by the synthetic dimension. In particular, we demonstrate how the energetic nature of the synthetic dimension combined with the quasienergy spectrum of the periodically driven channel allows for the direct and unambiguous observation of the quantized Hall effect in a two-reservoir geometry. Our work illustrates how topological properties of matter can be accessed in a minimal one-dimensional setup, with direct and practical experimental consequences.},

  abstract = {The interplay of topology and non-Hermiticity has led to diverse, exciting manifestations in a plethora of systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of non-Hermiticity in the Chern insulating Haldane model on a dice lattice. Due to the presence of a nondispersive flat band, the dice-Haldane model hosts a topologically rich phase diagram with the nontrivial phases accommodating Chern numbers ±2. We introduce non-Hermiticity into this model in two ways—through balanced non-Hermitian gain and loss, and by nonreciprocal hopping in one direction. Both these types of non-Hermiticity induce higher-order exceptional points of order three. Remarkably, the exceptional points at high-symmetry points occur at odd integer values of the non-Hermiticity strength in the case of balanced gain and loss, and at odd integer multiples of 1/√2 for nonreciprocal hopping. We substantiate the presence and the order of these higher-order exceptional points using the phase rigidity and its scaling. Furthermore, we construct a phase diagram to identify and locate the occurrence of these exceptional points in the parameter space. Non-Hermiticity has yet more interesting consequences on a finite-sized lattice. Unlike for balanced gain and loss, in the case of nonreciprocal hopping, the nearest-neighbor lattice system under periodic boundary conditions accommodates a finite, nonzero spectral area in the complex plane. This manifests as the non-Hermitian skin effect when open boundary conditions are invoked. In the more general case of the dice-Haldane lattice model, the non-Hermitian skin effect can be caused by both gain and loss or nonreciprocity. Fascinatingly, the direction of localization of the eigenstates depends on the nature and strength of the non-Hermiticity. We establish the occurrence of the skin effect using the local density of states, inverse participation ratio, and the edge probability and demonstrate its robustness to disorder. Our results place the dice-Haldane model as an exciting platform to explore non-Hermitian physics.},

  abstract = {We systematically study topological phases of insulators and superconductors (or superfluids) in three spatial dimensions. We find that there exist three-dimensional (3D) topologically nontrivial insulators or superconductors in five out of ten symmetry classes introduced in seminal work by Altland and Zirnbauer within the context of random matrix theory, more than a decade ago. One of these is the recently introduced Z2 topological insulator in the symplectic (or spin-orbit) symmetry class. We show that there exist precisely four more topological insulators. For these systems, all of which are time-reversal invariant in three dimensions, the space of insulating ground states satisfying certain discrete symmetry properties is partitioned into topological sectors that are separated by quantum phase transitions. Three of the above five topologically nontrivial phases can be realized as time-reversal invariant superconductors. In these the different topological sectors are characterized by an integer winding number defined in momentum space. When such 3D topological insulators are terminated by a two-dimensional surface, they support a number (which may be an arbitrary nonvanishing even number for singlet pairing) of Dirac fermion (Majorana fermion when spin-rotation symmetry is completely broken) surface modes which remain gapless under arbitrary perturbations of the Hamiltonian that preserve the characteristic discrete symmetries, including disorder. In particular, these surface modes completely evade Anderson localization from random impurities. These topological phases can be thought of as three-dimensional analogs of well-known paired topological phases in two spatial dimensions such as the spinless chiral (px±ipy)-wave superconductor (or Moore-Read Pfaffian state). In the corresponding topologically nontrivial (analogous to “weak pairing”) and topologically trivial (analogous to “strong pairing”) 3D phases, the wave functions exhibit markedly distinct behavior. When an electromagnetic U(1) gauge field and fluctuations of the gap functions are included in the dynamics, the superconducting phases with nonvanishing winding number possess nontrivial topological ground-state degeneracies.},

  abstract = {We present a simple probabilistic algorithm for solving k-SAT and more generally, for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). The algorithm follows a simple local search paradigm (S. Minton et al., 1992): randomly guess an initial assignment and then, guided by those clauses (constraints) that are not satisfied, by successively choosing a random literal from such a clause and flipping the corresponding bit, try to find a satisfying assignment. If no satisfying assignment is found after O(n) steps, start over again. Our analysis shows that for any satisfiable k-CNF-formula with n variables this process has to be repeated only t times, on the average, to find a satisfying assignment, where t is within a polynomial factor of (2(1-1/k))/sup n/. This is the fastest (and also the simplest) algorithm for 3-SAT known up to date. We consider also the more general case of a CSP with n variables, each variable taking at most d values, and constraints of order l, and analyze the complexity of the corresponding (generalized) algorith m. It turns out that any CSP can be solved with complexity at most (d/spl middot/(1-1/l)+/spl epsiv/)/sup n/.},

Then, the boundaries of initial superpixels are obtained according to the probabilities and the commute time. The initial superpixels are iteratively optimized by the new energy function, which is defined on the commute time and the texture measurement. Our LRW algorithm with self-loops has the merits of segmenting the weak boundaries and complicated texture regions very well by the new global probability maps and the commute time strategy. The performance of superpixel is improved by relocating the center positions of superpixels and dividing the large superpixels into small ones with the proposed optimization algorithm. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method achieves better performance than previous superpixel approaches.},

We find nontrivial generalizations of the Chern number in two dimensions, and a new classification in one dimension, whose topology is determined by the energy dispersion rather than the energy eigenstates. We then study the bulk-edge correspondence and the topological phase transition in two dimensions. Different from the Hermitian case, the transition generically involves an extended intermediate phase with complex-energy band degeneracies at isolated “exceptional points” in momentum space. We also systematically classify all types of band degeneracies.},

It will be shown that this algorithm performs an oracle search on a database of N items with O(√N) calls to the oracle, yielding a speedup similar to other quantum search algorithms. It appears that the quantum random-walk formulation has considerable flexibility, presenting interesting opportunities for development of other, possibly novel quantum algorithms.},

For open quantum systems, a short-time evolution can often be well described by the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, while long-time dynamics calls for the Lindblad master equations, in which the Liouvillian superoperators generate time evolution. In this Letter, we find that Liouvillian superoperators can exhibit the non-Hermitian skin effect, and uncover its unexpected physical consequences. It is shown that the non-Hermitian skin effect dramatically shapes the long-time dynamics, such that the damping in a class of open quantum systems is algebraic under periodic boundary conditions but exponential under open boundary conditions. Moreover, the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Bloch bands cause a chiral damping with a sharp wave front. These phenomena are beyond the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians; instead, they belong to the non-Hermitian physics of full-fledged open quantum dynamics.},

Typical properties of the underlying models are present in our semiclassical-topological hybrid system, allowing us to investigate an interplay between semiclassical bifurcations at mean-field level and topological phases. Our results show that bifurcations of the energy landscape lead to diverse ordered quantum phases. Furthermore, the study of the quantum fluctuations around the mean-field solution reveals the existence of nontrivial topological phases. These are characterized by the emergence of localized states at the edges of a chain with free open-boundary conditions.},

The temporal channel in particular allows one to achieve higher-dimensional topological effects by driving the system with several incommensurate frequencies. However, dissipation is generally detrimental to such topological effects. Here we introduce a photonic molecule subjected to dissipation and several radio-frequency and optical drives as a candidate system for observing quantized transport along Floquet synthetic dimensions. We describe preliminary experiments contrasting the topological and trivial phases. Topological energy pumping in the incommensurately modulated photonic molecule is enhanced by the driven and dissipative nature of our platform. Furthermore, we provide a path for realizing Weyl points and measuring the Berry curvature emanating from these reciprocal-space magnetic monopoles and illustrate the capabilities for higher-dimensional topological Hamiltonian simulation in this platform. Our approach enables direct k-space engineering of a wide variety of Hamiltonians using modulation bandwidths that are well below the free spectral range of integrated photonic cavities.},

Topological quantum computation aims to achieve this goal by using non-Abelian quantum phases of matter. Such phases allow for quantum information to be stored and manipulated in a nonlocal manner, which protects it from imperfections in the implemented protocols and from interactions with the environment. Recently, substantial progress in this field has been made on both theoretical and experimental fronts. We review the basic concepts of non-Abelian phases and their topologically protected use in quantum information processing tasks. We discuss different possible realizations of these concepts in experimentally available solid-state systems, including systems hosting Majorana fermions, their recently proposed fractional counterparts, and non-Abelian quantum Hall states.},

The stochastic fermionic hierarchy derived here contains Grassmannian noise, which makes it difficult to simulate numerically due to its anti-commutative multiplication. Therefore, in our second approach we eliminate the noise by deriving a related hierarchy for density matrices. A similar reformulation of the bosonic hierarchy of pure states to a master equation hierarchy and its relation to the hierarchical equations of motion of Tanimura and Kubo is also presented.},

In this paper we describe how to generalize this marker to 1D and 3D systems by showing that the relevant expressions accurately describe the phenomenon of topological pumping given by the first and second Chern numbers in 1D and 3D, respectively. In addition to providing general derivations, we verify the markers by numerically considering model Hamiltonians. These results will open the door for future studies, including the influence of disorder on topological pumping and topological phase transitions in odd-dimensional systems.},

Here, by using tunable superconducting circuits, we experimentally demonstrate two methods to directly measure the quantum metric tensor for characterizing the geometry and topology of underlying quantum states in parameter space. The first method is to probe the transition probability after a sudden quench, and the second one is to detect the excitation rate under weak periodic driving. Furthermore, based on quantum metric and Berry-curvature measurements, we explore a topological phase transition in a simulated time-reversal-symmetric system.

Specifically we show that electronic spin coherence can be reversibly mapped onto the collective state of the surrounding nuclei. The coherent transfer can be efficient and fast and it can be used, when combined with standard resonance techniques, to reversibly store coherent superpositions on the time scale of seconds. This method can also allow for “engineering” entangled states of nuclear ensembles and efficiently manipulating the stored states. We investigate the feasibility of this method through a detailed analysis of the coherence properties of the system.},

In the spatially uniform case, the Hamiltonian's non-Hermitian symmetries allow its eigenstates to be mapped to a pair of Hermitian Dirac subsystems. When a wave is transmitted across an interface between two spatially uniform domains with different parameters, an anomalous form of Klein tunneling occurs, whereby reflection is suppressed while the transmittance is substantially higher or lower than unity. The interface can even function as a simultaneous laser and coherent perfect absorber. Remarkably, the violation of flux conservation occurs entirely at the interface, with no wave amplification or damping taking place in the bulk. Moreover, at energies within the Dirac mass gaps, the interface can support exponentially localized boundary states with real energies. These features of the continuum model can be reproduced in non-Hermitian lattice models.},

In our model-independent approach, the dynamics are only constrained by the physical symmetries, which can be completely encoded using a suitable C*-superalgebra. Contrary to existing literature, we do not use K-theory groups to classify phases in an absolute sense, but to classify topological obstructions between phases. The Periodic Table of Kitaev is exhibited as a special case within our framework, and we prove that the phenomena of periodicity and dimension shifts are robust against disorder and magnetic fields.},

Firstly, the properties, classifications and compounds of TI are introduced. Secondly, the preparation and doping of TI are assessed. Some results are listed. (1) Although various preparation methods are used to improve the crystal quality of the TI, it cannot reach the industrialization. Fermi level regulation still faces challenges; (2) The carrier type and lattice of TI are affected by non-magnetic impurities. The most promising property is the superconductivity at low temperature; (3) Magnetic impurities can destroy the time-reversal symmetry of the TI surface, which opens the band gap on the TI surface resulting in some novel physical effects such as quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Thirdly, this paper summarizes various applications of TI including photodetector, magnetic device, field-effect transistor (FET), laser, and so on. Furthermore, many of their parameters are compared based on TI and some common materials. It is found that TI-based devices exhibit excellent performance, but some parameters such as signal to noise ratio (S/N) are still lower than other materials. Finally, its advantages, challenges and future prospects are discussed. Overall, this paper provides an opportunity to improve crystal quality, doping regulation and application of TI.},

This “discontinuous” quantum walk employs perfect quantum-state transfer between two nodes of specific subgraphs chosen to implement a universal gate set, thereby ensuring unitary evolution without requiring the introduction of an ancillary coin space. The run time is linear in the number of simulated qubits and gates. The scheme allows multiple runs of the algorithm to be executed almost simultaneously by starting walkers one time step apart.},

In the on-state, the Fermi level lies in the bulk bandgap and the electrons travel ballistically through the topologically protected edge states even in the presence of imperfections. In the off-state the Fermi level moves into the bandgap and electrons suffer from severe back-scattering. An off-current more than two-orders below the on-current is demonstrated and a high on-current is maintained even in the presence of imperfections. At low drain-source bias, the output characteristics are like those of conventional field-effect transistors, at large drain-source bias negative differential resistance is revealed. Complementary n- and p-type devices can be made enabling high-performance and low-power electronic circuits using imperfect two-dimensional topological insulators.},

In this work, we go beyond the known description of the non-Hermitian topological phase and find a different type of BBC that appears in generalized boundary conditions. The generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) possesses non-trivial topological structures in the intermediate boundary condition between open and periodic boundary conditions. Unlike the conventional BBC, the topological phase transition is characterized by the generalized momentum touching of GBZ, which manifests as exceptional points. As a realization of our proposal, we suggest the non-reciprocal Kuramoto oscillator lattice, where phase slips accompany exceptional points as a signature of such topological phase transition. Our work establishes an understanding of non-Hermitian topological matter by complementing the non-Hermitian BBC as a general foundation of the non-Hermitian topological systems.},

It is possible to solve the master equation in a short-time regime and find expressions for the decay rates as a function of the dimension d of the qudits. While we provide an explicit proof that the system relaxes to the Gibbs state for arbitrary qudits, we also prove that above a certain crossover temperature the qutrits' initial decay rate is smaller than the original case for qubits.

  abstract = {Thermalization and scrambling are the subject of much recent study from the perspective of many-body quantum systems with locally bounded Hilbert spaces (“spin chains”), quantum field theory, and holography. We tackle this problem in 1D spin chains evolving under random local unitary circuits and prove a number of exact results on the behavior of out-of-time-ordered commutators (OTOCs) and entanglement growth in this setting. These results follow from the observation that the spreading of operators in random circuits is described by a “hydrodynamical” equation of motion, despite the fact that random unitary circuits do not have locally conserved quantities (e.g., no conserved energy). In this hydrodynamic picture, quantum information travels in a front with a “butterfly velocity” vB that is smaller than the light-cone velocity of the system, while the front itself broadens diffusively in time. The OTOC increases sharply after the arrival of the light cone, but we do not observe a prolonged exponential regime of the form ∼eλL(t−x/v) for a fixed Lyapunov exponent λL. We find that the diffusive broadening of the front has important consequences for entanglement growth, leading to an entanglement velocity that can be significantly smaller than the butterfly velocity. We conjecture that the hydrodynamical description applies to more generic Floquet ergodic systems, and we support this idea by verifying numerically that the diffusive broadening of the operator wavefront also holds in a more traditional nonrandom Floquet spin chain. We also compare our results to Clifford circuits, which have less rich hydrodynamics and consequently trivial OTOC behavior, but which can nevertheless exhibit linear entanglement growth and thermalization.},

  abstract = {The article is a short opinionated review of the quantum treatment of electromagnetic circuits, with no pretension to exhaustiveness. This review, which is an updated and modernized version of a previous set of Les Houches School lecture notes, has three main parts. The first part describes how to construct a Hamiltonian for a general circuit, which can include dissipative elements. The second part describes the quantization of the circuit, with an emphasis on the quantum treatment of dissipation. The final part focuses on the Josephson nonlinear element and the main linear building blocks from which superconducting circuits are assembled. It also includes a brief review of the main types of superconducting artificial atoms, elementary multi-level quantum systems made from basic circuit elements.

  abstract = {In a recent publication (Wang and Clerk 2012 Phys. Rev. Lett. 108 153603), we demonstrated that one can use interference to significantly increase the fidelity of state transfer between two electromagnetic cavities coupled to a common mechanical resonator over a naive sequential-transfer scheme based on two swap operations. This involved making use of a delocalized electromagnetic mode which is decoupled from the mechanical resonator, a so-called ‘mechanically dark’ mode. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a new ‘hybrid’ state transfer scheme that incorporates the best elements of the dark-mode scheme (protection against mechanical dissipation) and the double-swap scheme (fast operation time). Importantly, this new scheme also does not require the mechanical resonator to be prepared initially in its ground state. We also provide additional details of the previously described interference-enhanced transfer schemes, and provide an enhanced discussion of how the interference physics here is intimately related to the optomechanical analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency. We also compare the various transfer schemes over a wide range of relevant experimental parameters, producing a ‘phase diagram’ showing the optimal transfer scheme for different points in parameter space.},

We simulate quench dynamics between distinct Floquet topological phases using quantum-walk dynamics and experimentally characterize DQPTs and the underlying DTOPs through interference-based measurements. The versatile photonic quantum-walk platform further allows us to experimentally investigate DQPTs for mixed states and in parity-time-symmetric nonunitary dynamics for the first time.

But rather than being an unavoidable nuisance, non-Hermiticity can be precisely controlled and hence used for sophisticated applications, such as optical sensors with enhanced sensitivity. In our work, we implement a non-Hermitian photonic mesh lattice by tailoring the anisotropy of the nearest-neighbor coupling. The appearance of an interface results in a complete collapse of the entire eigenmode spectrum, leading to an exponential localization of all modes at the interface. As a consequence, any light field within the lattice travels toward this interface, irrespective of its shape and input position. On the basis of this topological phenomenon, called the “non-Hermitian skin effect,” we demonstrate a highly efficient funnel for light.},

We show how the family of possible QSWs encompasses both the classical random walk (CRW) and the quantum walk (QW) as special cases but also includes more general probability distributions. As an example, we study the QSW on a line and the glued tree of depth three to observe the behavior of the QW-to-CRW transition.},

  abstract = {We revisit the problem of classifying topological band structures in non-Hermitian systems. Recently, a solution has been proposed, which is based on redefining the notion of energy band gap in two different ways, leading to the so-called “point-gap” and “line-gap” schemes. However, simple Hamiltonians without band degeneracies can be constructed which correspond to neither of the two schemes. Here, we resolve this shortcoming of the existing classifications by developing the most general topological characterization of non-Hermitian bands for systems without a symmetry. Our approach, which is based on homotopy theory, makes no particular assumptions on the band gap, and predicts significant extensions to the previous classification frameworks. In particular, we show that the one-dimensional invariant generalizes from Z winding number to the non-Abelian braid group, and that depending on the braid group invariants, the two-dimensional invariants can be cyclic groups Zn (rather than Z Chern number). We interpret these results in terms of a correspondence with gapless systems, and we illustrate them in terms of analogies with other problems in band topology, namely, the fragile topological invariants in Hermitian systems and the topological defects and textures of nematic liquids.},

In equilibrium the angular momenta of the spin-orbit split heavy-hole states lie in the plane of the 2D layer. When an electric field is applied across the hole channel, a nonzero out-of-plane component of the angular momentum is detected whose sign depends on the sign of the electric field and is opposite for the two edges.

  abstract = {A random walk is known as a random process which describes a path including a succession of random steps in the mathematical space. It has increasingly been popular in various disciplines such as mathematics and computer science. Furthermore, in quantum mechanics, quantum walks can be regarded as quantum analogues of classical random walks. Classical random walks and quantum walks can be used to calculate the proximity between nodes and extract the topology in the network. Various random walk related models can be applied in different fields, which is of great significance to downstream tasks such as link prediction, recommendation, computer vision, semi-supervised learning, and network embedding. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of classical random walks and quantum walks. We first review the knowledge of classical random walks and quantum walks, including basic concepts and some typical algorithms. We also compare the algorithms based on quantum walks and classical random walks from the perspective of time complexity. Then we introduce their applications in the field of computer science. Finally we discuss the open issues from the perspectives of efficiency, main-memory volume, and computing time of existing algorithms. This study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring random walks and quantum walks together.},

  abstract = {Bulk–boundary correspondence, a guiding principle in topological matter, relates robust edge states to bulk topological invariants. Its validity, however, has so far been established only in closed systems. Recent theoretical studies indicate that this principle requires fundamental revisions for a wide range of open systems with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

We directly measure the underlying topological invariants through time-averaged mean chiral displacements, which are consistent with our experimental observation of topological phase transitions. We then observe interaction-induced localization in the quantum-walk dynamics, where atoms tend to populate a single momentum-lattice site under interactions that are nonlocal in momentum space.

  abstract = {The bulk-boundary correspondence is crucial to topological insulators. It associates the existence of boundary states (with zero energy and possessing chiral or helical properties) with the topological numbers defined in bulk. In recent years, topology has been extended to non-hermitian systems, opening a new research area called non-hermitian topological insulator. In this paper, however, we will illustrate that the bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold in these new models. This is because a prerequisite condition: ‘the boundaries cannot alter most of the bulk states, so as to the topological numbers defined on them’ does not hold any longer. This cuts out the correspondence between the topological numbers and the boundary states. We will illustrate that, as approaching the open boundary condition by eliminating the strength of the hopping between the two ends of a chain, a new series of exceptional points must be passed through and the topological structure of the spectrum in the complex plane has been changed. This makes the spectrum topology different for the chains with and without boundaries. We also discuss that such exotic behavior does not emerge when the open boundary is replaced by a domain-wall. So the index theorem can be applied to the systems with domain-walls but cannot be further used to those with open boundaries.},

Here we exactly solve a quantum mechanical Lindblad master equation describing a dissipative topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain of fermions for both open boundary condition (OBC) and periodic boundary condition (PBC). We find that the extreme sensitivity on the boundary conditions associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect is directly reflected in the rapidities governing the time evolution of the density matrix giving rise to a Liouvillian skin effect. This leads to several intriguing phenomena including boundary sensitive damping behavior, steady state currents in finite periodic systems, and diverging relaxation times in the limit of large systems. We illuminate how the role of topology in these systems differs in the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian limit and the full master equation framework.},

We find that the non-Markovian decoherence dynamics of the probing spin can manifest the topological structure of the spin chain. By controlling the external magnetic field on the Ising chain, we find a close relationship between the topological phase transition and the non-Markovian dynamics in the real-time domain.

When the original Hermitian Hamiltonian has spinless time-reversal symmetry, it is impossible to have skin modes; on the other hand, if the Hermitian Hamiltonian has spinful time-reversal symmetry, skin modes can be induced by on-site dissipations under certain circumstances. As a concrete example, we employ the Rice-Mele model to illustrate our results. Furthermore, we predict that the skin modes can be detected by the chiral tunneling effect; that is, the tunneling favors the direction where the skin modes are localized. Our Letter reveals a no-go theorem for the emergence of skin modes and paves the way for searching for quantum systems with skin modes and studying their novel physical responses.},

Intriguingly, our analysis reveals that the combination of symmetry and non-Hermiticity results in topological degeneracies of energy bands which we call symmetry-protected exceptional rings (SPERs). We observe the emergence of SPERs by analyzing a non-Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian. Furthermore, by employing the dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate the emergence of SPERs in a correlated honeycomb lattice model whose single-particle spectrum is described by a non-Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian. We uncover that the SPERs survive even beyond the non-Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian, which is related to a zeroth Chern number. The argument of symmetry protection also holds for three dimensions, elucidating the presence of a symmetry-protected exceptional torus.},

The application to the spin-boson model with the discretization of a bosonic bath with arbitrary continuous spectral density is described in detail, and very accurate solutions can be obtained. The quantum phase transition in the nontrivial sub-Ohmic case can be located by the fidelity and the order-parameter critical exponents for the bath exponents s{$<$}1/2 can be correctly given by the fidelity susceptibility, demonstrating the strength of the approach.},

  abstract = {As an exotic state of quantum matter, topological insulators have promising applications in new-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. The realization of these applications relies critically on the preparation and properties understanding of high-quality topological insulators, which however are mainly fabricated by high-cost methods like molecular beam epitaxy. We here report the successful preparation of high-quality topological insulator Bi2Se3/Si heterostructure having an atomically abrupt interface by van der Waals epitaxy growth of Bi2Se3 films on Si wafer. A simple, low-cost physical vapor deposition (PVD) method was employed to achieve the growth of the Bi2Se3 films. The Bi2Se3/Si heterostructure exhibited excellent diode characteristics with a pronounced photoresponse under light illumination. The built-in potential at the Bi2Se3/Si interface greatly facilitated the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, enabling the photodetector to have a high light responsivity of 24.28 A W–1, a high detectivity of 4.39 × 1012 Jones (Jones = cm Hz1/2 W–1), and a fast response speed of aproximately microseconds. These device parameters represent the highest values for topological insulator-based photodetectors. Additionally, the photodetector possessed broadband detection ranging from ultraviolet to optical telecommunication wavelengths. Given the simple device architecture and compatibility with silicon technology, the topological insulator Bi2Se3/Si heterostructure holds great promise for high-performance electronic and optoelectronic applications.},

Meanwhile, we define another topological invariant via the single-particle density matrix, which works for general gapped systems and is equivalent to the former for the case of weak coupling to an environment. We also discuss two applications. For time-reversal-invariant insulators, the Z2 index can be expressed by the invariant of each spin subsystem. As a second application, we consider the proximity effect when an ordinary insulator is coupled to a topological insulator.},

While such classifications have been widely explored in the context of Hermitian systems, a complete understanding of the roles of more general non-Hermitian symmetries and their associated classification is still lacking. Here, we derive a periodic table for noninteracting SPTs with general non-Hermitian symmetries. Our analysis reveals additional non-Hermitian topological classes, while also naturally incorporating the entire classification of Hermitian systems as a special case of our scheme. Building on top of these results, we derive two independent generalizations of Kramers theorem to the non-Hermitian setting, which constrain the spectra of the system and lead to different topological invariants. To elucidate the physics behind the periodic table, we provide explicit constructions of non-Hermitian topological invariants, focusing on the symmetry classes in zero, one, and two dimensions with non-Hermitian topological classifications beyond those previously discussed (e.g., Z in zero dimensions, Z2 in one and two dimensions). These results thus provide a framework for the design and engineering of non-Hermitian symmetry-protected topological systems.},

Here, we formulate and quantitatively examine the effect of a quantum bath on these topological edge modes. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we study the ground state of a composite system of spin-1 quantum chain, where the system and the bath degrees of freedom are treated on the same footing. We focus on the dependence of these edge modes on the global and partial symmetries of system-bath coupling and on the features of the quantum bath. It is shown that the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) plays a special role for an open quantum system, where an emergent partial TRS breaking will result in a TRS-protected topological mode diffusing from the system edge into the bath, thus make it useless for quantum computation.},
